Syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons
Syria destroyed all the declared opportunities for production of chemical weapons, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons admitted.
This first disarmament stage Damascus finished the day before the deadline.
By November 1st, Syria was to destroy the manufacturing and other auxiliary facilities intended for use of  toxic substance , BBC reports.
The destruction of toxic substances themselves or their chemical components must be completed by the middle of 2014 .
According to the representative of the OZHO , currently toxic substances are in sealed repositories.
International inspectors went to Syria after in the Damascus vicinity on August 21st more than 1,400 people were killed in the chemical attack were killed , according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time and to destroy infrastructure for mixing chemicals and munitions in order to not allow Syrian authorities to produce more chemical weapons. 
These manufacturing facilities will now be watched carefully to prevent their repair.
The next milestone is the middle of November: by this time the OZHO and Syria must agree to a detailed plan of destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances.
There are a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by western inlelligence.
They will readily point out to inspectors new objects to test if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not fully compliant.
The United States believed that the shelling was held by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this was the work of the Syrian rebels.
According to the agreement mediated by Russia , the world community demanded from the Syrian leadership to destroy or render inoperable all opportunities for the production of shells, toxic gases, and liquids for filling shells with these substances.
Now , when this phase has passed, the next step must be to destroy the chemical weapons that the Syrian army has.
it is assumed that this arsenal could have more than 1,000 tons of toxic substances кожно-нарывного__kozhno-naryvnogo paralizing, mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places.
For the destruction of the above arsenal, the OZHO and the Syrian authorities have two weeks to agree on their timetable of action.
The head of the OZHO field operations Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "personally watched the destruction of the equipment."
“Now they have no opportunity to conduct further production or mix chemical weapons, ” he said .
In the statement, the OZHO said that its inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria to make sure that factories where shells and toxic substances are manifactured are either destroyed or are out of order.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out an inspection, the report says, but the equipment was moved and inspected by specialists of the OZHO.
According to Smith, the process of destruction of infrastructure for chemical weapons production was  "not easy" as work had to be cariied out in the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OZHO was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith , he inspectors have not yet found time to celebrate this--they were too busy with work.
