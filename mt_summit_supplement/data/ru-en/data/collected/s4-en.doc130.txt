He added : “ We are in a new world where people are ready to blow up themselfs .
Radical extremism  in the world with not have any petty  determined to kill and blow up people, and attack the government .

Meanwhile , US lawmakers  will go to Europe to help resolve issues associated with the alleged US spying in abroad; and to convince europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism measures with the united states , said the chairman of the senate subcommittee on european affairs on thursday .
The senator from connecticut , chris murphy said that this weeek he talked with members of the european parliament  and the other parties. He said that he is concerned about their threats to suspend participation in the anti-terrorist organizations because of disappointment in connection with the persecution of the national security agency .

News that the nsa collected millions of records of telephone calls from Europe worsen relations with some US allies , although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate; and reflected a misunderstanding that collected metadata nato allies and which they shared with the united states .
Snoud presented the other released documents showing that the nsa continued monitoring the mobile phone of the german chancellor Angela Merkel , as well as phones of approximately 34 other world leaders .
Director of national intelligence James Klapper defended spying activities in respect of allies as necessary and said that it is commonplace on both sides .

He said that European leaders should not hide from people what spyware programs they have used for many years .
“ While we can change our tracking program for a better protection of european rights , they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only people involved in intelligence activities , ” said Murphy.
