john kerry demonstrated easing tactics to protect u.s. tracking programs , making an unprecedented acknowledgment that in some cases , u.s spying " went way too far. ”
the secretary also acknowledged that the guilty , along with barack obama , who have been “ on autopilot ” during the appearance of the high-profile revelations by edward Snowden about the espionage activities in the nsa .
these leaksof information have put the us government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
speaking via video link on an open government conference in london , Mr. kerry said : “ there is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government actually analyzed some things happening on autopilot , because that possibility already existed — during the second world war , in the very difficult years of the cold war , and , of course , september 11 . ”
then he became the first senior member of the government of the united states who recognized that the us espionage has gone too far , but stressed that individual rights were not violated .
he said : “ in some cases this has come way too far.
and the president is determined to shed light on the current question and explain to the people , and now conducts a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has the feeling of abuse .
i assure you , the abuse of innocent people is not present in this process . ”
mr kerry insisted , however , that the nsa acted out of good intentions and that its tracking operation saved many lives .
he added : “ we are working a new world where people are ready to blow up themselves .
in the world there are radical extremism , careless and determined to kill people , blowing up people and attacking the government .
and if you were able to intercept it , stop it before it happens ?
we actually prevented crashing planes , explosions of buildings and killing people because we were able to learn more about these plans in advance . ”
meanwhile , u.s. lawmakers will go to Europe to help resolve issues associated with the alleged u.s. espionage abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism measures with the united states , said the chairman of the senate subcommittee on European affairs on Thursday .
The senator from connecticut , Chris Murphy said he talked with members of the european parliament , and the other parties this week and is concerned about their threats to suspend participation in the anti-terrorist organizations because of disappointment in connection with the persecution of the national security agency .
“ for u.s national security interests it is really important that the Europeans remain our supporters in respect of our joint counter-terrorism efforts , ” said democrat Murphy , who works in the position of first term and is the chairman of the international relations of the senate subcommittee on European affairs , in an interview from Washington .
“ and i am going to europe , to give them an understanding that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism , despite their anger over these nsa programs . ”
news that the nsa collected millions of records of telephone calls in Europe worsened relations with some allies of the us , although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding that collected metadata nato allies and which they shared with the united states .
Other talks brought the attention to Snowdens released documents showing that the nsa continued monitoring the mobile phone of german chancellor Angela Merkel , as well as phones of approximately 34 other world leaders .
director of national intelligence James Kapper defended espionage activities in respect of allies as necessary and said that it is a common activity on both sides .
against the backdrop of this hype Murphy said his office will organize a trip for members of congress , which is expected to take place this year , and that he hopes that the delegation will include members of both parties and both houses .
the names of the other participating legislators should be voiced in the coming days .
according to him , the program of the trip is still at the development stage .
although Murphy has said that the goal of the trip is to improve relations , he said that “ a degree of rigidity well-meaning ” will emerge .
he said that european leaders must be honest with its people in what spyware programs they have used for many years .
“ while we can change our tracking program to better protect the rights of europeans , they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only people involved in intelligence activities , ” Murphy said .
meanwhile , this weekend Mr. Kerry will head to the middle east and to poland for the solving of the problems of hostility against the u.s. strategy in Syria , Egypt and Iran , but also the united states intelligence activity .
