In its proposal, Greece made notable concessions, according to the sources consulted in the Eurogroup.
It promises to scrupulously comply with payments to creditors, and above all recognizes
that the current programme is the basis on which  a compromise agreement for the extension of financial assistance must be found.
Additionally, you agree that that extension be reviewed by the European Commission, the ECB, and the IMF
-three institutions formerly known as troika, although it is presumed that the trio will now operate separately.
The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, sees "positive signs" on the  Greek Government's request
that can pave the way for a compromise between Athens and its euro partners.
President Juncker, who has held intensive talks with the President of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem,
and with the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, during the night, and this morning,
sees in this letter of request a positive signal, said community spokesman Margaritis Schinas.
Athens has negotiated around the clock in the final hours to formalize an admissible request by euro partners,
that is based, according to the first reports, on a draft that was prepared jointly by the Ministry and the European Commission on Monday.
Greece did not want an extension of the current rescue with the associated conditions (cuts and reforms).
And Europe wants Tsipras to pass through the hoop, to give him some flexibility once he accepts the imposed rules.
A compromise agreement, is most likely to result at the end, based off of the proposal submitted by Greece,
but in which the Eurogroup will include demands from Germany and company, according to the sources that were consulted.
Negotiations are currently taking place. 
And not too long: the current schedule ends in February
and the financial needs of Greece cannot be met by the Greek State without the help of its European partners.
Athens and its banks do not have access to the market. 
The economy has stopped. 
Capitals are escaping without stopping
And Athens does not even have a primary surplus (excluding interest payments) to show for itself and negotiate with.
The Greek request will be examined this Thursday by the Eurogroup working group
and on Friday  by the Ministers of the euro zone (Eurogroup), as has been confirmed by Dijsselbloem on Twitter.
The ECB last night gave a boost to Athens with the extension of the emergency liquidity lines.
