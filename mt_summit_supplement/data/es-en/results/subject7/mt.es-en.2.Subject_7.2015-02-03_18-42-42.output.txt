If it is accepted by the Eurogroup, the Tsipras and Varoufakis offer would give a boost to the ailing economy, finances, and markets in Greece.
The first reaction of the market was sudden: a drop in the premium risk and the immediate rise of the euro.
Although the markets discredited the agreement days ago, despite the exchange of increasingly heated statements coming from both sides.
The Government of Alexis Tsipras has opted for a "debt bridge" agreement to weather the coming six months
-to negotiate a new rescue - fulfilling the bulk of the commitments,
but leaving others aside due to the dramatic crisis affecting the country.
Athens, aware that it lacks support, gave  a dose of unexpected transparency on Wednesday
and its Minister of Finance, Yanis Varoufakis, published a juicy package of documents detailing their demands.
Above all, it specifies some of its concessions to its members through an agreement.
Varoufakis, replicated the barrage of criticism in several capitals in this fashion, which have accused Athens of not specifying its offer again and again.
Greece needs 17 million this year to pay off its creditors, and the incipient recession,
the fall in government revenues and openings in banking limit its room to operate.
According to the Declaration of intent of Varoufakis, Athens calls for a "bridge agreement" and in return ensures that it will pay religiously
and that will make reforms and cuts, but at a less bloody pace for all.
The Greek Government is asking for 1,900 million from the profits gained from the purchase of Greek debt on behalf of the ECB.
It is also claiming a sum of 11 billion  to stabilize its banks.
And it calls for allowing their institutions to extend the limit of Treasury bills that can be purchased.
In consideration, it promises to persevere for reforms (which continue to not be specified),
It promises to do away with interest groups and says it will adopt measures against corruption and tax evasion.
It also asks some arnica - social expenditure for the most pressing problems - and imposes a considerable amount of red tape
No to cutting pensions
No to raising the. 
Not to evictions.
No to the privatization programme at full speed that the troika wanted
Not to unusable fiscal surpluses. And no to the extension of the current program and the requirement of itsuccessful completion
