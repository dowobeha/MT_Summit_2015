Tsipras and Varoufakis' offer, if it is accepted by the Eurogroup, would give a boost to the ailing economy, finances and markets in Greece.
The first reaction of the market was not expected: a drop in the premium risk and immediate increase of the euro.
Although the markets discounted the agreement for days, despite the fact that statements were more and more loud by both sides.
The Government of Alexis Tsipras has opted for a "debt bridge" agreement to weather the coming six months
-to negotiate a new rescue - serving the bulk of commitments,
but leaving aside other commitments for the dramatic crisis affecting the country.
Athens, aware that it lacks support, gave a dose of unexpected transparency on Wednesday
and the Minister of Finance, Yanis Varoufakis, published a juicy package of documents detailing their requests.
Above all, it specificies some of their concessions to members for the sake of an agreement.
Varoufakis so said the barrage of criticism in several capitals, which have accused Athens again and again of not specifying its offer.
Greece needs 17 billion this year to pay its creditors, and the incipient recession,
falling government revenues and openings in banking reduce room for manoeuvre.
According to the declaration of intent of Varoufakis, Athens calls for a "bridge agreement" and in return ensures that it will pay religiously
and that it will make reforms and cuts, but at a less bloody pace for all.
The Greek Government asked for 1,900 million from the profits gained from the purchase of Greek debt by the ECB.
It also claims an 11 billion fund to stabilize their banks.
And it calls for allowing their institutions to extend the limit of Treasury bills that can be purchased.
After consideration, they agree to persevere in reforms (which still does not detail enough),
It promises to do away with interest groups and says it will adopt measures against corruption and tax evasion.
It also asks some arnica - social expenditure for the most pressing problems - and imposes several red lines.
No to cuting pensions. 
No to raising VAT. 
No to evictions.
No to the privatization programme at full speed that troika wanted.
No to the unworkable fiscal surpluses. And no to the extension of the current program and the requirement of successful completion of it.
