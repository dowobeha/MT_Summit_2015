In its proposal, Greece made notable concessions, according to the sources consulted in the Eurogroup.
It promises to comply scrupulously with payments to creditors, and above all recognizes
that the current programme is the basis on which a compromise agreement for the extension of financial assistance can be found.
You further agree that this extension be reviewed by the European Commission, the ECB, and the IMF
-The three institutions were formerly known as troika, although it is now presumed that the trio will operate separately.
The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, at the request of the Greek Government sees "positive signs"
that can pave the way for a compromise between Athens and its euro partners.
President Juncker, who has held intensive talks with the President of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem,
and with the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, throughout the night, and this morning,
have seen this letter of request as a positive sign, said community spokesman Margaritis Schinas.
Athens has negotiated around the clock in the final hours to formalize an admissible request by euro partners,
that is based, according to the first reports, on a draft prepared jointly by the Ministry and the European Commission on Monday.
Greece did not want an extension of the current rescue with associated conditions (cuts and reforms).
And Europe wants Tsipras to pass through the hoop, to give some flexibility once the imposed rules are accepted.
The most likely, in the end, is a compromise agreement, as part of the basis of the proposal submitted by Greece,
but in which the Eurogroup will include demands for Germany and company, according to the sources consulted.
the bargaining remains for a time.
And not too long: the current program ends in February
and the financial needs of Greece are impractical for the Greek State without the help of its European partners.
Athens and its banks do not have access to the market. 
The economy has stopped. 
Capital flight is not stopped.
And Athens already has a primary surplus (excluding interest payments) that show off and negotiate.
The Greek request will be examined Thursday by the Eurogroup working group
and Friday morning by the Ministers of the euro zone (Eurogroup), as also confirmed by Dijsselbloem on Twitter.
The ECB gave a boost to Athens last night, with the extension of the emergency liquidity lines.
