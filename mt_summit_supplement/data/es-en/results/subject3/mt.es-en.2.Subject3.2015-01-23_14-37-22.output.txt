Tsipras and Varoufakis' offer, if it is accepted by the Eurogroup, would give a boost to the ailing economy, finances and markets in Greece.
The first reaction of the market was not expected: a drop in the premium risk and the immediate ascent of the euro.
Although the markets discounted the agreement for days, despite the cross statements being more and more racy by both sides.
The Government of Alexis Tsipras has opted for a "debt bridge" agreement to weather the upcoming six months
-to negotiate a new bailout - serving the bulk of the acquired commitments,
but leaving aside others for the dramatic crisis affecting the country.
Athens, aware that it lacks support, gave a dose of unexpected transparency on Wednesday
and its Minister of finance, Yanis Varoufakis, published a juicy package of documents detailing their demands.
Above all, it specified some of its concessions to members for the sake of an agreement.
Varoufakis, replied to the barrage of criticism in several capitals, which have accused Athens of not specifying its offer again and again.
Greece needs 17 billion this year to pay its creditors, and the incipient recession,
falling government revenues and openings in banking reduce its room for manoeuvre.
According to Varoufakis' delcaration of his intentions, Athens calls for a "bridge agreement" and in return ensures that it will pay religiously
and that it will make reforms and cuts, but at a less bloody pace for all.
The Greek Government asked for 1,900 million from the profits gained from the purchase of Greek debt by the ECB.
It also claims a 11 billion Fund to stabilize their banks.
And it calls for an allowance by their institutions to extend the limit of Treasury bills that can be purchased.
In consideration, it undertakes to persevere in reforms (which still is not detailed enough),
It promises to do away with interest groups and says it will adopt measures against corruption and tax evasion.
It also asks some arnica - social expenditure for the most pressing problems - and imposes several red lines.
To not cut pensions. 
To not raise VAT. 
To not have evictions.
To not have the privatization programme at the full speed that the troika wanted.
To not have the unworkable fiscal surpluses. And to not have the extension of the current program and the requirement of successful completion of it.
