Tsipras and Varoufakis' offer, if accepted by Eurogroup, would give a boost to the ailing economy, finances, and markets in Greece.
The first market reaction was not expected: a drop of the premium risk and an immediate ascent of the euro.
Although the markets discounted the agreement days ago, despite crossing the statements more and more by both sides.
The Government of Alexis Tsipras has opted for a "debt bridge" agreement to weather the next six months
-until negotiating a new rescue - serving the bulk of commitments,
but leaving others aside in the dramatic crisis affecting the country.
Athens, aware that it lacks support, gave a dose of unexpected transparency this Wednesday
and the city's Minister of finance, Yanis Varoufakis, published a hefty package of documents detailing their demands.
Above all, it clarifies some of its concessions to members for the sake of an agreement.
This is how Varoufakis replicated the barrage of criticism in several capitals, which have accused Athens of not specifying its offer time and again.
Greece needs 17 billion to pay its creditors this year, and the incipient recession,
the falling government revenues, and openings in banking reduce its room for manoeuvre.
According to Varoufakis's Declaration of Intent, Athens calls for a "bridge agreement," and in return ensures that it will pay religiously
and will make reforms and cuts, but at a pace less bloody for all.
The Greek Government asked for 1,900 million from the profits gained from the purchase of Greek debt by the ECB.
It also claims an 11 billion fund to stabilize their banks.
It also demands that their institutions recieve an extension on the limit of treasury bills that can be purchased.
In consideration, it agrees to persevere in reforms (which is still detailed enough),
It promises to do away with interest groups and says it will adopt measures against corruption and tax evasion.
It also asks for some type of arnica - social expenditure for the most pressing problems - and imposes several red lines.
Not to cut pensions. 
Not to raise the VAT. 
No to evictions.
No to the privatization programme at full speed wanted by troika.
Not to the unworkable fiscal surpluses, and no to the extension of the current program and the requirement of successful completion of it.
