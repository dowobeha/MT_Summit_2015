Tsipras and Varoufakis' offer, if accepted by the Eurogroup, would give a boost to the ailing economy, finances, and markets in Greece.
The first reaction of the market was unexpected: a drop in premium risks and an immediate increase in the euro.
However, the markets had been discounting the agreement for days, despite the exchange of increasingly heated statements from both sides.
The Government of Alexis Tsipras has opted for a "debt bridge" agreement to weather the coming six months
- even negotiating a new bailout - meeting the bulk of the acquired commitments,
but leaving aside others because of the dramatic crisis affecting the country.
Athens, aware of its lack of support, gave a dose of unexpected transparency Wednesday
and its Minister of Finance, Yanis Varoufakis, published a sizable package of documents detailing their demands.
Above all, it specifies some of its concessions to members for the sake of an agreement.
Varoufakis thus replied to the barrage of criticism from several capitals, which have accused Athens of not specifying its offer again and again.
Greece needs 17 billion this year to pay its creditors, and the incipient recession,
falling government revenues and openings in the banking system reduce its room for manoeuvre.
According to Varoufakis' declaration of intentions, Athens calls for a "bridge agreement" and in return promises that it will pay religiously
and that it will carry out reforms and cuts, but at a less violent pace for everyone.
The Greek government is asking for 1.9 billion from the profits gained from the purchase of Greek debt by the ECB.
It also claims an 11 billion fund to stabilize its banks.
And it calls for allowing its institutions to extend the limit on the Treasury bills that can be purchased.
In consideration, it promises to persevere in its reforms (which continue without being sufficiently detailed),
It promises to do away with interest groups and says it will adopt measures against corruption and tax evasion.
It also asks for some arnica - social expenditure for the most pressing problems - and imposes several red lines.
No to cutting pensions. 
No to raising the VAT. 
No to evictions.
No to the full-speed privatization programme wanted by the troika.
No to the unworkable fiscal surpluses. And no to the extension of the current program and the requirement that it be successfully completed.
