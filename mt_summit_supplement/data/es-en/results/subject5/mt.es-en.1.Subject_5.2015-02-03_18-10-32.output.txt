In its proposal, Greece made notable concessions, according to the sources consulted in the Eurogroup.
It promises to comply scrupulously with payments to creditors, and above all recognizes
that the current programme is the basis on which a compromise agreement for the extension of financial assistance can be found.
It also agrees for this extension to be reviewed by the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF
-three institutions formerly known as troika, although presumably now that trio will operate separately.
The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, at the request of the Greek Government sees "positive signs"
that can pave the way for a compromise between Athens and its partners in the Eurozone.
President Juncker, who has held intensive talks with the President of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem,
and with the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, during last night and this morning
sees in this letter of request a positive sign, said community spokesman Margaritis Schinas.
In the final hours, Athens has negotiated around the clock to formalize a request acceptable to its euro partners,
which is based, according to the first reports, on a draft prepared jointly by the Ministry and the European Commission on Monday.
Greece did not want an extension of the current bailout, with its associated conditions (cuts and reforms).
And Europe wants Tsipras to agree, in order to give it some flexibility once the imposed rules are accepted.
In the end, the most likely event is a compromise agreement derived from the basis of the proposal submitted by Greece,
but in which the Eurogroup will include demands from Germany and company, according to the sources consulted.
Bargaining will continue for a while. 
And not too long: the current program ends in February
and the financial needs of Greece cannot be met by the Greek government without the help of its European partners.
Athens and its banks do not have access to the market. 
The economy has stopped. 
Capital flight isn't slowing down.
And Athens already has a primary surplus (excluding interest payments) with which to show off and negotiate.
The Greek request will be examined Thursday by the Eurogroup team
and Friday morning by the Ministers of the euro zone (Eurogroup), which was also confirmed by Dijsselbloem on Twitter.
Last night the ECB gave a boost to Athens, with the extension of the emergency liquidity lines.
