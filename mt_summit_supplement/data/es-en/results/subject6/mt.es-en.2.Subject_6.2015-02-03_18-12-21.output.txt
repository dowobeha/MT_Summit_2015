If the offer made by Tsipras and Varoufakis is accepted by Eurogroup, it would give a boost to the ailing economy, finances and markets in Greece.
The first reaction by the market came soon: the premium risk and immediate raise of the price of euro.
Markets discounted the agreement for several days now, despite the  exchange of increasingly racy exchanges by both ends.
 Alexis Tsipras government has opted for a "debt bridge" agreement to weather the next six months
--until a new rescue is negociated-- complying with all of the commitments,
but leaving others aside due to the dramatic crisis that the country is going through.
Athens, aware of its lack of support, showed this past Wednesday a dose of unexpected transparency
and its Minister of finance, Yanis Varoufakis, published an considerable stack of documents detailing its demands.
It mainly lists in detail some of its concessions with members for the sake of an agreement.
Varoufakis insisted in all the criticism which blames Athens of not being specific about their offer in several capitals
Greece needs 17 billion this year to pay its creditors, and the incipient recession,
the decrease in government revenue, and openings in banking reduce the posibility to manage the situation
According to the Declaration of intent by Varoufakis, Athens is demanding a "bridge agreement" and in return, it ensures that it will pay thoroughly
and that will make reforms and cuts, but at a less difficuly pace for all.
The Greek Government asked 1,900 million from the profits gained from the purchase of Greek debt by the ECB.
It also claims a 11 billion Fund to stabilize their banks.
And it calls for allowing their institutions to extend the limit of Treasury bills that can be purchased.
In consideration, it commits to persevere in reforms (which is not still detailed enough),
It promises to do away with interest groups and says it will adopt measures against corruption and tax evasion.
It also asks some arnica - social expenditure for the most pressing problems - and imposes several red lines.
Not to cut pensions. 
Not to raise VAT. 
Not to the evictions.
No to the privatization programme at full speed that troika intended.
Not to the unworkable fiscal surpluses. And no to the extension of the current program and to the requirement of successful completion of it.
