In its proposal, Greece made notable concessions, according to the sources consulted in Eurogroup.
It promises to comply scrupulously with payments to creditors, and above all recognizes
that the current program is the basis on which a compromise agreement on the extension of financial assistance could happen.
it also agrees that this extension be reviewed by the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF
-- the three institutions previously  known as troika--, although presumably now they will operate separately.
The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker considers that there are positive signs in the request of the Greek Government 
that can pave the way for an agreement between Athens and its partners in the euro.
President Juncker, who has held regular conversations with the President of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem,
and with the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, during the night, and this morning,
sees in this letter of request a positive signal,  says Margaritis Schinas, the community spokeman
In the last hours, Athens has negotiated around the clock to formalize an acceptable request by euro partners,
that is based, according to the first reports, on a draft prepared on Monday by the Ministry and the European Commission together.
Greece did not want an extension of the current rescue given the associated conditions (cuts and reforms).
And Europe wants Tsipras to pass through the hoop, to give to it some flexibility once it accept the rules imposed.
In the end, it is likely that a compromise agreement is reached, which is generated based on the proposal submitted by Greece,
but in which the Eurogroup will include demands for Germany and company, according to the sources consulted.
Negotiations will still continue for a while
But not for too long because the current program ends in February
and Greece's financial needs cannot be met by the Greek State without the help of its European partners.
Athens and its banks do not have access to the market. 
The economy has stalled. 
Capital loss continues.
And Athens does not even have a primary surplus (excluding interest payments) with which it can show off and negotiate.
The Greek request will be examined Thursday by the Eurogroup working group
and Friday morning by the Ministers of the zone euro (Eurogroup), as it was confirmed by Dijsselbloem on Twitter.
 Last night ECB  gave a boost to Athens, with the extension of the emergency liquidity lines.
