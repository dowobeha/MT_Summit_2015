Tsipras and Varoufakis' offer, if it is accepted by the Eurogroup, would give a boost to the ailing economy, finances and markets in Greece.
The first reaction of the market was not expected; there was a drop in the risk premium and an immediate ascent in the euro.
The markets discounted the agreement for days, despite the statements by both sides that became more and more harsh.
The Government of Alexis Tsipras has opted for a "debt bridge" agreement to weather the next six months
-even negotiating a new rescue - serving the bulk of commitments,
but leaving aside others in the dramatic crisis that is affecting the country.
Athens, aware that it lacks of support, gave a dose of unexpected transparency on Wednesday
and its Minister of finance, Yanis Varoufakis, published a juicy package of documents detailing their demands.
Above all, it specifies some of its concessions to members for the sake of an agreement.
Varoufakis, replied to the barrage of criticism in several capitals, which have accused Athens again and again of not specifying its offer.
Greece needs 17 billion this year to pay its creditors, and the incipient recession,
falling government revenues and openings in banking reduce its room for manoeuvre.
According to Varoufakis' Declaration of intent, Athens requests a "bridge agreement" and in return ensures that it will pay faithfully
and that will make reforms and cuts, but at a less bloody pace for all involved.
The Greek Government asked for 1.9 billion from the profits gained from the purchase of Greek debt by the ECB.
It also requests a fund of 11 billion to stabilize its banks.
And it calls for allowing its institutions to extend the limit of Treasury bills that can be purchased.
In consideration, it undertakes to persevere in reforms (which is still not detailed enough),
it promises to do away with interest groups and says it will adopt measures against corruption and tax evasion.
It also asks for arnica - social expenditure for the most pressing problems - and imposes several guidelines.
Not to cut pensions. 
Not to raise VAT. 
Not to carry out evictions.
No to the privatization programme at full speed that the troika wanted.
No to the unworkable fiscal surpluses. And no to the extension of the current program and the requirement of its successful completion.
