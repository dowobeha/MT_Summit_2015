In its proposal, Greece made notable concessions, according to the sources consulted in the Eurogroup.
It promises to comply scrupulously with payments to creditors, and above all recognizes
that the current programme is the basis for finding a compromise agreement for the extension of financial assistance.
Furthermore, it agrees that this extension may be reviewed by the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF
- three institutions formerly known as troika - although presumably now that trio will operate separately.
The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, at the request of the Greek Government, sees "positive signs"
that could pave the way for a compromise between Athens and its Euro partners.
President Juncker, who has held intensive talks with the President of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem,
and with the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, during the night and also this morning,
sees in this request letter a positive sign, said community spokesman Margaritis Schinas.
Athens has negotiated around the clock in these last  hours to formalize an admissible request for its euro partners,
based, according to the first reports, on a draft prepared jointly by the Ministry and the European Commission last Monday.
Greece did not want an extension of the current rescue with its associated conditions (cuts and reforms).
And Europe wants Tsipras to jump through the hoop, to give some flexibility once he accepts the imposed rules.
In the end, a compromise agreement is likely, as part of the basis of the proposal submitted by Greece,
but in which the Eurogroup will include demands for Germany and company, according to the sources consulted.
Bargaining will last for a while. 
And not too long: the current program ends in February
and the financial needs of Greece are insurmountable by the Greek State without the help of its European partners.
Athens and its banks do not have access to the market. 
The economy has stopped. 
Capital flight is not stopped.
And Athens does not even have a primary surplus (excluding interest payments) to show off and negotiate with.
The Greek request will be examined Thursday by the Eurogroup working group
and Friday morning by the Ministers of the Euro zone (Eurogroup), as also confirmed by Dijsselbloem on Twitter.
Last night the ECB gave a boost to Athens, with the extension of the emergency liquidity lines.
