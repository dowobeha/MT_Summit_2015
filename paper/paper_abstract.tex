Phrase-based machine translation can be configured to produce alignment data that indicates which machine translated target language words correspond to which original source language words.

In most prior work that examined the efficacy of post-editing machine translation, post-editors were presented with machine translations (and in most cases the original source language sentences) without also being presented with source-to-target alignment links.

We select two news articles, and ask six Russian-English bilinguals to post-edit English machine translation results, in some cases using alignments and in other cases without.

%As part of the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, \citet{2014_WMT_Schwartz_etal} examined the extent to which monolingual native English speakers were able to post-edit machine translation of news articles into fluent, adequate English translations of Russian source sentences.
