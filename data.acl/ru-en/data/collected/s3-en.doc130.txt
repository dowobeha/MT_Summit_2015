John Kerry says in his unprecedented statement that US espionage “has gone too far"
John Kerry demonstrated easing tactics of the US surveillance programs, making an unprecedented statement that in some cases  US spying "has gone too far.”
The Secretary also acknowledged his guilt along with Barack Obama in that he has been “on autopilot” during the appearance of the high-profile information about Edward Snowden and the NSA espionage activities.
These leaks have put the US government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the open government conference in London , Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the government actually took some things happening on autopilot, because that possibility already existed — during the Second World War, in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, on September 11.”
Then he became the first senior member of the government of the United States to recognize that the US espionage has gone too far but stressed that individual rights were not violated.
He said: “In some cases this has gone too far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this question and make a statement to people, and now he conducts a thorough analysis to ensure that no one feels abused.
I assure you  that innocent people are not being abused in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted out of good intentions and that its surveillance operation saved many lives.
He added , “We work in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world senseless and determined to kill people, blow up people, and attack the government .
What if you were able to intercept it and stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented planes crashes, explosions of buildings and killing people because we were able to learn more about these plans in advance ”
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will go to Europe to help resolve issues associated with the alleged US espionage abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism measures with the United States, said the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday .
The Senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy said he talked with members of the European Parliament and the other parties this week and is concerned about their threats to suspend participation in the anti-terrorist organizations because of disappointment in connection with the surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency .
“For US national security interests it is really really important that Europeans remained our supporters in respect of our joint counter-terrorism efforts,” said democrat Murphy in an interview from Washington, the Chairman of the International Relations of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs, working in the position his first term.
“And I am going to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.”
News that the NSA collected millions of records of telephone calls in Europe worsened relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding regarding collected metadata that NATO allies collected and which they shared with the United States.
In other quoted information documents released by Snowden showed that the NSA continued monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel`s mobile phone as well as phones of approximately 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Klapper defended espionage activities in respect to allies as necessary and said that it is common for both sides.
In the midst of all of this Murphy said that his office will organize a trip for the members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating legislators should be revealed in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still at the development stage.
Although Murphy has said that the goal of the trip is to improve relations, he also said that “a degree of well-meant rigidity” will take place.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their people in what spyware programs they have used for many years.
“While we can change our surveillance program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only people involved in intelligence activities, ” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry will head to the Middle East and to Poland  this weekend to address hostility against the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran and also the United States intelligence activity .
