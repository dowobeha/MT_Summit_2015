John Kerry says in his unprecedented acknowledgment that American espionage “has gone too far"
John Kerry demonstrated easing of tactics to protect US tracking programs by making an unprecedented acknowledgment that in some cases. American espionage "has gone too far . ”
The secretary also acknowledged that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama of being “on autopilot ” when Edward Snowden's high-profile disclosures of NSA espionage activities appeared. 
These leaks have put the US government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
During his speech via video call at the open government conference in London, Mr. kerry said: “ There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, actually took some things that were happening on autopilot, because such possibility already existed — during the second world war, and in the very difficult years of the cold war, and ,of course, on September 11.”
Then he became the first senior member of the government of the United States to recognize that the US espionage has gone too far, but stressed that no individual rights were violated.
He said: “In some cases it has gone too far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain everything to the people. Now he is conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one feels like he or she was abused.
I assure you that this process does not include any abuse of innocent people.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted out of good intentions and that its tracking operations saved many lives.
He added: “We work in a new world where people are ready to blow up themselves.
In the world there exists radical extremism, thoughtless and full of determination to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
And what if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually did prevent plane crashes, building explosions and murders because we were able to learn more about those plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will go to Europe to help resolve issues associated with the alleged American espionage abroad and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism measures with the United States, Chairman of the Senate European Affairs Subcommittee said Thursday .
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said that he had talked to the members of the European Parliament and other parties that week and was concerned about their threats to suspend participation in the anti-terrorist organizations because of disappointment in connection with the espionage by the National Security Agency .
“For US national security interests it is really important that Europeans remain our supporters in respect of our joint counter-terrorism efforts,” said democrat Murphy, first year in his position, chairman of the Senate International Relations European Affairs Subcommittee, in an interview from Washington .
“And i am going to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to fight against terrorism together, despite their anger over these NSA programs.”
News that the NSA collected millions of records of telephone calls in Europe worsen the relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week that the news were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures quoted documents published by Snowden showing that the NSA continued monitoring the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as phones of approximately 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Klapper defended espionage activities in respect of allies claiming that they were necessary and said that it was commonplace on both sides.
Against the backdrop of this hype Murphy said that his office was organizing a trip for Congress members, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators are expected to be made public in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still at the development stage.
Murphy said, though, that the goal of the trip is to improve relations. He said that “a degree of rigidity out of the desire to do better” is to be expected .
He said that European leaders must be honest with their people in what intelligence programs they themselves used for many years.
“While we can change our tracking prograsm to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only people involved in intelligence activities,” murphy said .
Meanwhile, this weekend Mr. Kerry will head to the Middle East and Poland to solve the problems of hostility against the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the American intelligence activities.
