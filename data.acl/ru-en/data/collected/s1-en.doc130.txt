John Kerry says in an unprecedented recognition that American espionage "went too far."
John Kerry promoted easing tactics to protect U.S. tracking programs, making an unprecedented acknowledgment that in some cases, U.S. spying " went too far.”
The secretary, along with Barack Obama, also acknowledged this mistake, that they have been “on autopilot ” since the appearance of the high-profile revelations by Edward Snowden about the espionage activities of the NSA .
These leaks have put the US government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies .
Speaking via video link in an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said : “ There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, actually handled some events on autopilot, because that possibility already existed — as it did during the second World War, and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and of course, September 11 . ”
Then he became the first senior member of the government of the United States to recognize that American espionage has gone too far, but stressed that no individual rights were violated .
He said : “In some cases this has gonr too far."
The president is determined to shed light on this question and to explain, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has felt abused.
"I assure you, the abuse of innocent people is not present in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted with good intentions and that its tracking operation saved many lives .
"We are in a new world where people are ready to blow up themselves," he said.
In the world there is radical extremism, безрассудный__bezrassudnyy and determined to kill people , blowing up people and attacking the government .
What if you were able to intercept it, and stop it before it happens ?
We actually prevent planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from killing because we were able to learn more about these plans in advance. ”
Meanwhile , U.S. lawmakers convened in Europe to help resolve issues associated with the alleged U.S. espionage abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism measures with the United States, said the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday .
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he talked with members of the European Parliament and other parties this week, and is concerned about their threats to suspend participation in the anti-terrorist organizations because of disappointment in connection with the persecution of the National Security Agency .
“ National security interests are really important to Europeans, who have remained our supporters in respect for our joint counter-terrorism efforts, ” said Democrat Murphy, who is in his first term as the Chairman of the International Relations of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington .
“So I am going to Europe, to help them understand that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs . ”
News that the NSA collected millions of records of telephone calls in Europe has worsened relations with some allies of the US, although the head of the agency said this week that this was inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding on collected metadata of NATO allies, which they shared with the United States .
In other news, Snowden released documents showing that the NSA continued monitoring the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as phones of approximately 34 other world leaders .
Director of National Intelligence James Klapper defended thes espionage activities as necessary and said that it is commonplace on both sides .
Against this backdrop Murphy said his office is organizing a trip for the members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and both houses .
The names of the other participating legislators should be voiced in the coming days .
According to him , the program of the trip is still in the development stage .
Although Murphy has said that the goal of the trip is to improve relations, he also said that “a degree of well-meaning rigidity ” will emerge .
He said that European leaders must be honest with his people in what spyware programs they have used for many years .
“ While we can change our tracking program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree that we are not the only people involved in intelligence activities, ” Murphy said .
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry will head this weekend to the Middle East and to Poland, to solve the problems of hostility against the U.S.. strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, but also for United States intelligence activity .
