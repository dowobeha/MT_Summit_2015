Syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons
Syria destroyed all the declared facilities for the production of chemical weapons , and was recognized by the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons .
This first stage of disarming Damascus was finished the day before the deadline .
Before November 1st,  Syria was to destroy the manufacturing and other auxiliary objects intended for combat training in the use of toxic substances , reports the BBC .
The destruction of the toxic substance stockpile and their chemical components should be completed by the middle of 2014 .
According to the representative of the OPCW,  toxic substances are currently in опечатанных__opechatannykh repositories .
International inspectors went to the outskirts of Damascus, Syria on August 21st after the chemical attack, which killed more than 1,400 people according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was to prevent Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons, and to destroy  equipment for mixing chemicals and munitions .
These manufacturing facilities will now be watched carefully to prevent their repair .
The next milestone is in the middle of November. By this time, the OPCW and Syria must agree to a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances.
There are many questions here .
Where will they be removed ?
Who will provide the equipment for this ?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by western auditors .
They will readily present inspectors with new objects to test if there are grounds on which to suspect  Damascus is not fully candid .
The United States believed that the shelling was aimed at regular troops .
Syria and Russia insist that this was the work of Syrian rebels .
The world community has demanded that Syrian leadership reach an accordance with Russia, and to destroy or make inoperable all ability to produce shells, toxic gases, and liquids for filling in these substances .
Now, since this phase is over, the next step must be to destroy  the existing Syrian army chemical weapons.
It is assumed that this arsenal could contain more than 1,000 tons of toxic substances including nerve paralyzers, mustard gas, and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places .
It is necessary for the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to stay within the agreed timetable of action of two weeks for its destruction .
Head of OPCW Field Operations Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors " personally watched the destruction of the equipment.
Now they have no opportunity to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapons,” he said.
In their statement , the OPCW said its inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and were convinced that the factories manufacturing shells and toxic substances were either destroyed or are in order .
The remaining two sites were too dangerous to carry out an inspection according to the document, but the equipment was carried out and inspected by OPCW specialists .
According to Smith , the destruction process of the production infrastructure was especially complex, as any work was in the ongoing conflict .
In early October , the OPCW was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. According to Smith, however, at the time of the celebration the inspectors were nowhere to be found - they were too busy with work .
