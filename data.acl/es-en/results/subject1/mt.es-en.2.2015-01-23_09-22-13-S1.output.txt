Tsipras and Varoufakis' offer, if it is accepted by the Eurogroup, would give a boost to the ailing economy, finances and markets in Greece.
The first reaction of the market happened quickly: the risk premium dropped and an immediate climb of the euro was seen.
Although the markets discounted the agreement days ago, despite the crossing of statements more and more the tone rises on both sides. 
The Government of Alexis Tsipras has opted for a "debt bridge" agreement to weather the coming six months
-until a new bailout is negotiated - serving the bulk of necessary commitments,
but leaving behind others due to the dramatic crisis affecting the country.
Athens, aware that it lacks support, this Wednesday showed a dose of unexpected transparency
and its Minister of finance, Yanis Varoufakis, published a large package of documents detailing their demands.
Above all, it specifies some of his concessions to members for the sake of an agreement.
Varoufakis, responded to the barrage of criticism in several capitals, which have accused Athens of not specifying its offer again and again.
Greece needs 17 billion this year to pay its creditors, and the incipient recession,
falling government revenues and openings in banking reduce its room for manoeuvre.
According to the Declaration of intent from Varoufakis, Athens calls for a "bridge agreement" and in return ensures that it will pay faithfully
and that it will make reforms and cuts, but at a less rapid pace for all.
The Greek Government asked for 1.9 billion from the profits gained from the purchase of Greek debt by the ECB.
It also claims an 11 billion Fund to stabilize their banks.
And it calls for allowing their institutions to extend the limit of Treasury bills that can be purchased.
To balance this out, it promises to persevere in reforms (which still lacks sufficient detail),
It promises to do away with interest groups and says it will adopt measures against corruption and tax evasion.
It also petitions for some arnica - social expenditure for the most pressing problems - and imposes several red lines.
To not cut pensions. 
To not raise VAT. 
To not allow the evictions.
No to the privatization programme at full speed that troika wanted.
No to the unworkable fiscal surpluses. And no to the extension of the current programme and the requirement of successful completion of it.
