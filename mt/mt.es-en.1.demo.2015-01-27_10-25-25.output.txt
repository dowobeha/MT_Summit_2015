In its proposal, Greece made notable concessions, according to the sources consulted in the Eurogroup.
It promises to comply scrupulously with payments to creditors, and above all recognizes
that the current programme is the basis on which can be found a compromise agreement for the extension of financial assistance.
You further agree that this extension be reviewed by the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF
-three institutions formerly known as troika, although presumably now that trio will operate separately.
The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, at the request of the Greek Government sees "positive signs"
that can pave the way for a compromise between Athens and its partners in the euro.
President Juncker, who has held intensive talks with the President of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem,
and with the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, during the night, and this morning,
seen in this letter of request a positive signal, said community spokesman Margaritis Schinas.
Athens has negotiated around the clock in the final hours to formalize an admissible request by euro partners,
that is based, according to the first reports, a draft prepared jointly by the Ministry and the European Commission on Monday.
Greece did not want an extension of the current rescue with associated conditions (cuts and reforms).
And Europe wants Tsipras pass through the hoop, to give some flexibility once you accept the imposed rules.
Is likely, in the end, a compromise agreement, as part of the basis of the proposal submitted by Greece,
but in which the Eurogroup will include demands for Germany and company, according to the sources consulted.
Bargaining is for a while. 
And not too long: the current program ends in February
and the financial needs of Greece are impractical by the Greek State without the help of its European partners.
Athens and its banks do not have access to the market. 
The economy has stopped. 
Capital flight is not stopped.
And Athens has even already a primary surplus (excluding interest payments) that show off and negotiate.
The Greek request will be examined Thursday by the Eurogroup working group
and Friday morning by the Ministers of the zone euro (Eurogroup), as also confirmed by Dijsselbloem on Twitter.
The ECB last night gave a boost to Athens, with the extension of the emergency liquidity lines.
