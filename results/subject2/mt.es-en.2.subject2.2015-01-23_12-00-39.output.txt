The offer from Tsipras and Varoufakis, if accepted by the Eurogroup, would give a boost to the ailing economy, finances and markets in Greece.
The first reaction of the market was unexpected: the drop of the premium risk and immediate ascent of the euro.
Although the markets discounted the agreement for days, the statements became more and more racy by both sides.
The Government of Alexis Tsipras has opted for a "debt bridge" agreement to weather the coming six months
-to negotiate a new rescue - serving the bulk of commitments,
but leaving aside others by the dramatic crisis affecting the country.
Athens, aware that it lacks support, gave a dose of unexpected transparency on Wednesday
and the Minister of Finance, Yanis Varoufakis, published a juicy package of documents detailing his demands.
Above all, it specifies some of its concessions to members for the sake of an agreement.
Varoufakis replied to the barrage of criticism in several capitals, which have accused Athens of not specifying its offer again and again.
Greece needs 17 billion this year to pay its creditors, and the incipient recession,
falling government revenues and openings in banking reduce its room for manoeuvre.
According to the declaration of intent of Varoufakis, Athens asks for a "bridge agreement" and in return ensures that it will pay religiously
and that it will make reforms and cuts, but at a less bloody pace for all.
The Greek government asked for 1,900 million from the profits gained from the purchase of Greek debt by the ECB.
It also claims a fund of 11 billion to stabilize its banks.
And it calls for allowing its institutions extend the limit of Treasury bills that can be purchased.
In consideration, it undertakes to persevere in reforms (still without sufficient details),
promises to do away with interest groups and says it will adopt measures against corruption and tax evasion.
It also asks for arnica - social expenditure for the most pressing problems - and imposes several red lines.
Not to cut pensions. 
Not to raise VAT. 
No evictions.
No to the privatization programme at full speed wanted by the troika.
No unworkable fiscal surpluses. And no extension of the current program and the requirement to successfully complete it.
