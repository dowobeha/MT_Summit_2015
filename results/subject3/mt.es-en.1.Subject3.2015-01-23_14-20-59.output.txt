In its proposal, Greece made notable concessions, according to the sources consulted in the Eurogroup.
It promises to comply scrupulously with payments to creditors, and above all recognizes
that the current programme is the basis on which a compromise agreement for the extension of financial assistance can be found .
You further agree that this extension be reviewed by the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF
-three institutions formerly known as troika, although presumably now that trio will operate separately.
The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, sees "positive signs" in the Greek Government request
that can pave the way for a compromise between Athens and its partners in the euro.
President Juncker, who has held intensive talks with the President of Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem,
and with the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, during the night, and this morning,
sees a positive sign in this letter of request, said community spokesman Margaritis Schinas.
Athens has negotiated around the clock in the final hours to formalize an admissible request by euro partners,
that is based, according to the first reports, on a draft prepared jointly by the Ministry and the European Commission on Monday.
Greece did not want an extension of the current bailout with associated conditions (cuts and reforms).
And Europe wants Tsipras to pass through the hoop, to give some flexibility once they accept the imposed rules.
Most likely, in the end, there will be a compromise agreement, as part of the base of the proposal submitted by Greece,
but in which Eurogroup will include demands for Germany and company, according to the sources consulted.
Bargaining will take a while. 
And there is not much time: the current program ends in February
and the financial needs of Greece are impractical by the Greek State without the help of its European partners.
Athens and its banks do not have access to the market. 
The economy has stopped. 
Capital flight has not stopped.
And Athens still does not have a primary surplus (excluding interest payments) with which to show off and negotiate.
The Greek request will be examined Thursday by the Eurogroup working group
and Friday morning by the Ministers of the euro area (Eurogroup), as also confirmed by Dijsselbloem on Twitter.
Last night the ECB gave a boost to Athens, with the extension of the emergency liquidity lines.
