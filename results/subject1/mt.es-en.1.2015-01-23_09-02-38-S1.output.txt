In its proposal, Greece made notable concessions, according to the consulted sources in the Eurogroup.
It promises to comply scrupulously with payments to creditors, and above all recognizes
that the current programme is the basis on which a compromise agreement can be found for the extension of financial assistance.
It further agrees that this extension be reviewed by the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF
- the three institutions formerly known as troika, although presumably now that trio will operate separately.
The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, sees within the Greek Government's petition "positive signs"
that can pave the way for a compromise between Athens and its partners in the euro.
President Juncker, who has held intense talks with the President of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem,
and with the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, during the night, and this morning,
a positive signal can be seen in this letter of request, said community spokesman Margaritis Schinas.
Athens has negotiated around the clock in the final hours to formalize an admissible request by euro partners,
that is based, according to the first reports, a draft prepared jointly by the Ministry and the European Commission last Monday.
Greece did not want an extension of the current bailout with the associated conditions (cuts and reforms).
And Europe wants Tsipras to pass through the hoop, to give some flexibility once the imposed rules are accepted.
It is most likely that, in the end, a compromise agreement, taking the proposal submitted by Greece as a starting point,
but in which the Eurogroup will include demands from Germany and company, according to the sources consulted.
There is still time for negotiation.
But not too long: the current program ends in February
it is impossible for the Greek State to assume the financial needs of Greece without the help of its European partners.
Athens and its banks do not have access to the market. 
The economy has stopped. 
Capital trading is not stopped.
And Athens does not even have a primary surplus (excluding interest payments) in order to boast and negotiate.
The Greek request will be examined this Thursday by the working Eurogroup.
and tomorrow, Friday, by the Ministers of the euro zone (Eurogroup), as also confirmed by Dijsselbloem on Twitter.
The ECB last night gave a boost to Athens, with the extension of the emergency liquidation lines.
