Syria Destroys Chemical Weaponry Equipment
Syria destroyed all the declared facilities for production of chemical weapons, Organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons admitted.
Damascus finished this first stage of disarmament one day before the deadline.
Syria was to destroy production and auxilliary facilities intended for preparation of combat toxic substances, BBC reports.
Destruction of toxic substances supplies and their chemical components must be completed by the middle of 2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, currently toxic substances are stored in sealed repositories .
International inspectors went to Syria after August 21 when on the outskirts of Damascus more than 1400 people, as reported by the US, were killed in a chemical attack.
The main task of the inspectors was to act quickly in order to prevent Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and equipping munitions .
These manufacturing facilities will now be monitored carefully to prevent their repair .
The next milestone is the middle of November, by which time the OPCW and Syria must agree on a detailed plan of destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances.
There are a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destructed?
Who will provide the equipment for it?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by western intelligence services.
They will readily advise inspectors on new facilities to check should there be any grounds to suspect that Damascus is not fully candid.
The United States believe that the attack was performed by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that it was the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership, as was agreed with help of Russian mediation, destroy or lead in inoperable all facilities for the production of shells, toxic gases and liquids, as well as facilities for filling the shells with those substances.
Now that this stage is passed, the next step must be the destruction of existing chemical weapons existing in Syria.
It is assumed that the arsenal might contain more than 1,000 tons of toxic substances including paralytic substances, mustard gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozen different places.
To destruct them it is necessary for the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to agree upon the timetable of activities. Two weeks were allocated for that .
Head of Field Operations with OPCW, Jerry Smith, told the BBC that his inspectors "monitored the destruction of the equipment personally."
“Now they have no opportunity to continue production or mixing of chemical weapons,” he said .
In its statement, the OPCW said its inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and were convinced that the factories for manufacturing of shells and toxic substances were either destroyed or rendered non-functional.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to carry out an inspection, the document states, but its equipment was carried out and inspected by OPCW specialists .
According to Smith, the process of destruction of infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons as "especially challenging" as the works had to be performed during an ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize; however, according to Smith, inspectors have not had any time to celebrate it as they were too busy working.
