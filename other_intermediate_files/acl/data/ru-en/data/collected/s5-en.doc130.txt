speaking via video link at an open government conference in london , mr kerry said : “ there is no doubt that the president and i , as well as other members of the government actually took some things happening on autopilot , because that possibility already existed — and during the second world war , and in the very difficult years of the cold war , and , of course , september 11th . ”
then he became the first senior member of the government of the united states to recognize that the us espionage has gone too far , but stressed that individual rights were not violated .
he said, “ in some cases it has gone too far .
and the president is determined to shed light on this question and explain it to people , and now is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one feels abused .
i assure you , the abuse of innocent people is not current practice. ”
mr kerry insisted , however , that the nsa acted out of good intentions and that its tracking operations have saved many lives .
he added : “ we are in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up .
in the world there is radical extremism , безрассудный__bezrassudnyy and determined to kill people , blowing up people and attack the government .
and if you were able to intercept it , stop it before it happens ?
we actually prevent crashing planes , explosions of buildings and killings of people because we were able to learn more about these plans in advance . ”
meanwhile , u.s. lawmakers направятся__napravyatsya in europe to help resolve issues associated with the alleged u.s. espionage abroad and to convince europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism measures with the united states , said the chairman of the senate subcommittee on european affairs on thursday .
 senator from connecticut , chris murphy said he talked with members of the european parliament , and the other parties on this week and is concerned about their threats to suspend participation in the anti-terrorist organizations because of disappointment in connection with the actions of the national security agency .
“ it is very important for US national security that europeans remain our supporters in respect to our joint counter-terrorism efforts , ” said democrat murphy ,currently serving his first term and serving as the chairman of the international relations of the senate subcommittee on european affairs , in an interview from washington .
“ and i am going to europe , to get them to understand that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism , despite their anger over these nsa programs . ”
news that the nsa collected millions of records of telephone calls in europe worsened relations with the us and some of its allies , although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding that collected meta-data nato allies and which they shared with the united states .
 other quoted Snowden documents разоблачениях__razoblacheniyakh released  showing that the nsa continued monitoring the mobile phone of german chancellor angela merkel , as well as phones of approximately 34 other world leaders .
director of national intelligence james clapper defended the espionage activities in respect of allies as necessary and said that it is commonplace on both sides .
against the backdrop of this hype murphy said his office organized a trip for members of congress , which is expected to take place this year , and that he hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and both houses .
the names of the other participating legislators should be known in the coming days .
according to him , the program of the trip are still at the development stage .
although murphy has said that the goal of the trip is to improve relations , he said that “ a degree of well-meaning rigidity ” will emerge .
he said that european leaders must be honest with their people in what spyware programs they have used for many years .
“ while we can change our tracking program to better protect the rights of europeans , they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only people involved in intelligence activities , ” murphy said .
meanwhile , mr kerry will head to the middle east and poland this weekend to solve the problems of hostility against the u.s. strategy in syria , egypt and iran , but also the united states intelligence activity .
