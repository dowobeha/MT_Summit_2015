syria destroyed equipment for chemo-weapons
syria destroyed all the declared facilities for production of chemical weapons , recognized by the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons .
this is the first stage of disarmament Damascus finished the day before the deadline .
Before 1 of november syria was to destroy the manufacturing and other auxiliary objects intended for combat training in the use of toxic substances , reports the bbc .
the destruction of the stockpile of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by the middle of 2014 .
according to the representative of the opcw , currently toxic substances are in sealed repositories .
international inspectors went to syria after on outskirts of damascus on 21 august in the chemical attack were killed , according to the united states , more than 1,400 people .
the main task of the inspectors was not lose time, to not allow syrian authorities to produce more  chemo-weapons and destroy infrastructure equipment for mixing chemicals and munitions .
These manufacturing facilities will now be carefully watched to prevent their mistakes.
the next milestone is the middle of november : by this time the opcw and syria must agree to a detailed plan of destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances .
There are a lot of questions here.
where will they be destroyed ?
who will provide the equipment for this ?
all syrian statements will be carefully checked by western monitoring services .
they will readily suggest to inspectors new ways to test if there are grounds to suspect that damascus is not fully candid .
the united states assumed that the shelling was conducted by regular troops .
syria and russia insist that this was the work of the syrian rebels .
the world community has demanded from the syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached and mediated by russia , is to destroy or bring to inoperable conditions all capacity for the production of shells , toxic gases and liquids and shells for filling in these substances .
now , when this phase passed , the next step must be to destroy existing chemo-weapons possesed by the Syrian army .
it is assumed that in this arsenal could be more than 1,000 tons of toxic substances, skin penatrating chemicals, mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places .
for its destruction it is necessary to the opcw and the syrian authorities for the agreed timetable of action - it is two weeks .
the head of the opcw field operations jerry smith told the bbc that his inspectors " personally watched the destruction of the equipment .
“ now they have no opportunity to conduct further production or mixing chemical weapons , ” he said .
in the statement , the opcw said its inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in syria and convinced the factories that the manufacturing of shells and toxic substances , should either destroyed or brought to order .
the remaining two missions are too dangerous to carry out an inspection , the document says , but the equipment was carried out and inspected by specialists of the opcw .
according to smith , the process of destruction of infrastructure for the production of chemo-weapons was "especailly not easy " as work had to be done during the ongoing conflict .
in early october , the opcw was awarded the nobel peace prize , however , according to smith , inspectors have not yet found time to celebrate - they were too busy with work .
