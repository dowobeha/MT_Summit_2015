<seg id="2">The remaining survivors and relatives of 202 victims of the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict of Umar Patek, the last of the conspirators to appear in court, and stated that he should be shot.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in south-east Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building the explosive devices used in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="4">He could be freed within 15 years, if he gets parole.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45th defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of attacks on two night club in the popular tourist area of kuta, during which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was also found guilty on a number of other charges related to terrorism, including in a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prosecutors have suggested life imprisonment, although they could request that the man, nicknamed "the master bomb-maker" for his reputation for making explosives, should be sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="8">This decision evokes painful memories for June Kortin, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old daughters Jane and Jenny in the terrorist attack, almost ten years ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">Barely concealing her own tears, she said that Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I really believe that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
<seg id="11">He must appear before the firing squad, "the AAP quoted Ms. Kortin.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I have to live every day knowing that I will never have grandchildren and I will never see my daughters."</seg>
<seg id="13">The "Sari" club was destroyed when a massive explosive device, left in a van parked outside, detonated just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.</seg>

<seg id="15">After that attack, he fell into a month-long coma and "died" three times, while connected to a life-support system.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell of "Jemaah Islamiyah", responsible for the bloodbath, along with Amrozi, Mukhlasa and Imam Samudry who were executed four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty all the more.</seg>
<seg id="18">To save his life, well, there is no reason to save his life.</seg>
<seg id="19">To get 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not so much.</seg>
<seg id="20">Patek is the last of the terrorist attack in Bali, to appear before a court of law.</seg>
<seg id="21">He was hiding for almost a decade, but in the end was arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda boss Osama bin Laden less than four months later.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the trial, an FBI agent testified that the intelligence indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to restore the ties between southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="23">"He didn't give up," said Ms. Kortin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently he regretted nothing about how much grief he caused others.</seg>
<seg id="25">The judgement came in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This year there will be a lot of tears," said Ms. Kortin.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patek can still appeal his sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1">The manufacturers of jet aircraft feud over seat width, when large orders at stake</seg>
<seg id="2">A violent dispute between the leading manufacturers of aircraft erupted about the width of the tourist class seats on long flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai air show this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dispute focuses on the dynamic of the width of the seats available to passengers on long-haul flights in economy class, whose interests are not always the centre of attention of the airlines, with the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in statements about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS.</seg>
<seg id="4">Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard, which would have included the width of the seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class cabins, but its main American rival, Boeing says it must be up to the airline.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales of increasingly large versions of their long-haul aircraft, and expected potentially record orders at the November 17 – 21 event.</seg>
<seg id="6">The layout of the rear part of the plane — especially whether it seats 9 or 10 people in a row — occupies a central place in statements about the economic performance of new projects such as the Mini-Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="7">Boeing argues that its new 777x will be reduced to 406 people on the basis of seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width, placed on the 10 in each row.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airbus says that its competing version, the A350 will transport 350 people in ecomomy class on seats 18 inches wide, located on nine in a row.</seg>
<seg id="9">Aircraft manufacturing giants often exchanged blows on technical issues with the help of professional advertising in the press.</seg>
<seg id="10">And now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public before the airshow in Dubai, where the 777x, is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Airbus recently demonstrated what may be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing an advertisement depicting three people in a restaurant, side by side, titled "Would you agree to that?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats narrower than those in regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Likhi.</seg>
<seg id="13">With modern changes of diet people have gaine weight, but economy seats have not changed dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since the beginning of the 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 introduced travelers to modern standards and long-distance travel abroad, the average weight of American men aged 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="15">Waist measurements of the average American male in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the U.S. Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus says that its rival is committed to the concept of the seats of the 1950s, when the average waist measurements of the traveling public were smaller.</seg>
<seg id="17">Airbus says it ordered a study indicating that an extra inch in seat width improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing disputed Airbus figures on the size of seats and said that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines to find balance between prices and amenities.</seg>
<seg id="19">Boing said studies show that the convenience of airline cabins depends not only on the width of the seats.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It really comes down to providing airlines choice and the opportunity to do what they believe they need to do to succeed," said Boeing cabin specialiston Kent Kreyver.</seg>
<seg id="21">They do not want us to be solved for them that will bring them profits.</seg>
<seg id="22">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="23">For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind this dispute is the race for orders for planes, worth at least in the $700 billion in the coming decades — enough to change the balance of the American and European exports.</seg>
<seg id="25">As first reported by the Reuters agency in July, the location of the seats is what fuels rivalry in the battle between the latest reactive aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="26">Airbus, as well as Boeing, also announced 20-percent improvements in profitability at one place in their latest long-haul jet models compared with the market leader in this segment, the 365-passenger boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="27">The numbers claimed by Boeing are based in part on comparing 777x 10-seat rows with the 9-seat row layout of the original 777.</seg>
<seg id="28">The win in the specific cost decreases when compared with the 10-seat row layout used currently.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The reason why boeing makes it, is to squeeze more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared with our development," said Kevin Keniston, Airbus head of passenger comfort in Europe.</seg>

<seg id="2">Under Vzirayushchey at them down the statue in Zamora, President Mashela of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo, to chant slogans about peace on one of the rare demonstrations here.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We want a return to peace; we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, executive director of the investment company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fearing for the future of her country, she traded a business suit for a t-shirt decorated the inscription "we demand security" in portuguese, and joined in the capital on thursday to a crowd in independence square.</seg>
<seg id="5">Within two weeks there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo — it is one of the most violent clashes since the signing of the ceasefire, more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Renamo was once a rebel movement, which was driven by the first white government of Rhodesia, and then the government of the South Africa of the apartheid era in an effort to destabilize the government of an independent country.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the armistice of 1992 it became the opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again return to full conflict, but recent events have made both foreign investors and local residents nervous.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, since the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years, from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling party, Frelimo, a leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party accuse each other in this tension.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Renamo party argues that the government has become the latest instigator of attacks, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on 17 october.</seg>
<seg id="12">The attack on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked a Renamo base and attempted to kill Afonso Dkhlakamu, the leader of the group — Renamo representative Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government blames Renamo for triggering clashes, accusing the party in an attack on soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza tried to allay fears of instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">Guebuza told AFP, the French information agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dkhlakama felt fewer constraints to use "all that is left of his forces to try to prove that he can impose the government own decisions."</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But worries have grown after reports that said Mazanga refused Renamo from the peace agreement of 1992.</seg>
<seg id="18">He told the financial times that meant Frelimo was party to the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Our goal is to return to talks, but very seriously," said Mazanga.</seg>
<seg id="20">Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which led to a series of clashes this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is two influential persons (Guebuza and Dkhlakama) struggling each other," said Joseph Khanlon, lecturer from Open University and an expert on Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="22">None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to go on the necessary concessions.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Renamo party, which tries to get electoral reform, has already announced that it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.</seg>
<seg id="24">Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators have interpreted it as an attempt to pressure the Oslabevshego movement to achieve concessions and financial bonuses from the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">The share of votes for Renamo has decreased since 1992, while a new party - the democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by former members of Renamo is expected to improve their performance in these elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza, who is to step down next year, when ends his second term, wants to destroy democracy in the country.</seg>
<seg id="28">"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he did not want to transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the post of president," said Mazanga.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear what possibilities Renamo has, but they have already had devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the motorway leading from the north to the south.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is just a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beyru — the port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June, Rio suspended use of the railways for about a week after Renamo threatened an attack on the railroad.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mazanga was straightforward when he was asked a question about whether Renamo repeat this threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Renamo party wanted to warn the international community that matters in Mozambique are not very good, "said Mazanga.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instability has added to discontent with the government, but many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recently more frequent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop independent media companies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Omar Sultuan, who participated in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Nobody cares, neither Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want a renewal of the world, they want to free access to the roads," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists shed light on how a dog's tail is related to its mood.</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier research has shown that happy dogs hold their tail on the right side (from the point of view of a dog), while alarmed dogs hold their tail mainly on the left side.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now, scientists say that other members of the dog's family may notice these subtle differences in tail position and react to them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a Professor at Trent University, says: "it is well known that in people the left and right side of the brain are involved differently in shaping the stimulators of positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Here we have tried to look at this and many other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that just like humans, in dogs the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.</seg>
<seg id="7">To learn more about how dogs react to various tails positions of other dogs, the researchers watched the animals when they watched films about other dogs.</seg>
<seg id="8">They measured the frequency of the animals' heartbeat and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
<seg id="9">Perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes heading in one direction, and sometimes — in another</seg>
<seg id="10">Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed videos of dogs with dogs — either a natural version or a silhouette, to get rid of any of the other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct more tail left or right."</seg>
<seg id="11">When the animals have seen that nothing in the rest of the tail expressing the dog moved to the right (from the point of view of the observed dog's tail), they were totally relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when they noticed that the tail was left mainly (again from the point of view of observed dog's tail), their heartbeat increased and they looked alarmed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Professor Vallortigara said that he does not think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other using these movements.</seg>
<seg id="14">In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience, about what movements they should worry about, and what not to.</seg>
<seg id="15">He says: "If there are several meetings with other dogs and holding their tail to one side is often associated with more friendly behavior, while the other side is less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts on the basis of that experience."</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers say that these results may give owners and veterinarians a deeper understanding of emotions of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="17">An expert in the field of behavior of dogs, John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher in the Veterinary School at Bristol University, said it was not the first study to test whether a value for dogs left and right side.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn the head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at peaceful dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">And in other scientific work at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "Dogs often approached the Sobak robot when its tail was held to the left, not right, rather than become alarmed — the opposite of behavior towards the Italian study."</seg>
<seg id="20">He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies are not entirely susceptible to animals in films or Sobak robots as dogs.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.</seg>
<seg id="22">"While on various mammals there is enough evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes, many details are yet to be specified, and dogs are no exception," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, given the ease with which their behavior can be observed, perhaps, soon we will understand why their tails sometimes heading in one direction, and sometimes — in another.</seg>

<seg id="1">How will business be conducted between Europe and England?</seg>
<seg id="2">The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April, with a mandate to poll representatives of business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the UK want to see in relations with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="3">To this end, we ordered the biggest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK business and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing a broad slice of business in the UK based on the size, sector and region.</seg>
<seg id="5">The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking for opportunities for exports outside europe, paying special attention to the countries which are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are stagnant.</seg>
<seg id="7">They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spend time on a long and difficult process of complicated reform of EU institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">When they were asked about their opinions on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to laws on products, most business leaders believed that control over these key areas of competence should be reclaimable by Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives have stated that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits from being in a commercial zone of Europe — even 40 percent of large enterprises, which are the most traditionally minded of all companies, have agreed with this.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last and most indicative — our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wants Britain to change its course on contract and on relations with the EU, based on trade, not politics.</seg>
<seg id="11">This result, which was among enterprises of all sizes including the largest business groups, shows that business insists on "meaningful change" that would bring powers back to Britain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stakes are high — the changes in the treaty and more favorable conditions for the UK will provide a 16 percent shift in voting for it to stay in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="13">The prime minister should not have any doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of British membership in the EU.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also shows that business expects the review will lead to a major shift in the balance of power back to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="15">The best conditions for British business will become increasingly necessary as the Eurozone is on a path of closer economic and financial integration.</seg>
<seg id="16">Priority should be given to jobs and growth in the UK and, as shown by the results of our survey for business this means greater focus on trade and fundamental changes in the standards of Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Siberia, peopse should not be devoted vegans: tomatoes are no replacement for meat</seg>
<seg id="2">Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, reports a correspondent for Ria Novosti.</seg>
<seg id="3">People who completely reject products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.</seg>
<seg id="4">They do not move here to this winter without a loss to health, and hothouse tomatoes will not compensate for that, say doctors interviewed about the new Siberian diet.</seg>
<seg id="5">Drink a liter of milk</seg>
<seg id="6">Strict vegetarianism becomes a way of life when abstaining not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, and eggs.</seg>
<seg id="7">But dietologists in Novosibirsk in Siberia and other cities believe people should to adhere to the same stringent standards in nutrition for health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Complete refusal of animal products harmful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for in a strictly plant based diet.</seg>
<seg id="10">You need to include milk or eggs in your diet, "stated dietitian Marina Bogay.</seg>
<seg id="11">She cites as an example that fish contains the essential omega-3 fatty acid.</seg>
<seg id="12">The richest such vegetable oil is linseed.</seg>
<seg id="13">"For a person to take in the necessary quantities, they would need to drink litres!" says a nutritionist.</seg>
<seg id="14">Doctors are confident that residents of Siberia need to pay special attention to their food in winter.</seg>
<seg id="15">Vegetarianism is especially questioned in this season.</seg>
<seg id="16">Reality in winter imposes higher requirements for food.</seg>
<seg id="17">To keep warm, you need the extra calories.</seg>
<seg id="18">"If people keep themselves away from animal products, can lead to a calorie deficit", experts say.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dietologist Olga Późniak agrees with this.</seg>
<seg id="20">She adds that imported fruits and vegetables are not a solution.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is better to eat mostly foods which are grown in the region of residence or where you were born.</seg>
<seg id="22">The genetic code is configured for better digestion of these products.</seg>
<seg id="23">And during the winter, people are not totally OK, your puppy and hot supchika or even something posytnee "- the doctor explains her position.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to her, vegans do have very useful foods, such as various grains, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples, and frozen berries remaining in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="25">But this is clearly not enough for nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to gastroenterologist Claudi Vracha, organisms in Siberians have sufficient vitamin levels only from mid August to mid September.</seg>
<seg id="27">The full transition to vegetarianism is difficult in our harsh environmental conditions, when the temperature can change 30 degrees per day and the snow is on the ground in May.</seg>
<seg id="28">To sustain life, the body will need energy, and that, above all, fat, "the medic concludes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Doctors say that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="30">As children grow up, they need a construction material, including in the form of amino acids.</seg>
<seg id="31">But by adhering to vegetarianism, we give them an inferior diet.</seg>
<seg id="32">Pregnant women also need high protein content, vitamins and trace elements in their diet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Vegans need them" - insists Bogay.</seg>
<seg id="34">Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, play with the toys which he wants ".</seg>
<seg id="35">His body is already formed, the skeleton and organs.</seg>
<seg id="36">But children still need to eat better.</seg>
<seg id="37">If the parents are depriving him of trace elements and amino acids, choosing for him that he will be there, it is just a violation of the rights of the child.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Deficits of those or other substances are needed for the development of the brain and bones," she says.</seg>
<seg id="39">All interviewed medical specialists agree on the low quality of the winter crop in greenhouses and imported fruit and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="40">Food brought up and grown in greenhouses contains fewer required trace elements than those (grown up) in the open ground.</seg>
<seg id="41">"They aren't quality products" says Bogay.</seg>
<seg id="42">Arifulina also notes that imported and hothouse vegetables and fruits are far from an ideal standard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sometimes the desire of the manufacturers to build larger crops damages the quality.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Apples are brown when cut, cucumbers quickly lose quality, and tasteless tomatoes" are examples given by doctors, adding that they likely contain excessive amounts of fertilizers.</seg>
<seg id="45">And they are not good sources of vitamins and fiber.</seg>
<seg id="46">Vera Petruk, a candidate of agricultural sciences in the laboratory at Siberian Physical-Technical Institute of Agricultural Issues disagrees with this.</seg>
<seg id="47">She says that with the right approach and proper observance of all standards and requirements, the cultivation of vegetables in greenhouses may succeed.</seg>
<seg id="48">If they try to push more into a square meter, then, of course, more often plants will require mineral fertilisers.</seg>
<seg id="49">For example, with too much nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes are growing quickly, but they are large and watery "- she explains, adding that the issue of quality, in the first place, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.</seg>

<seg id="32">They do not always have luck.</seg>
<seg id="33">More than once they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud.</seg>

<seg id="1">The "Russian mafia" in the United States a new name finally takes hold - "Fraternal Circle"</seg>
<seg id="2">This week in America new "Russian mafia" new names and four companies were added to blacklists.</seg>
<seg id="3">The US Treasury has designated three representatives from Russia, Uzbekistan and two Israeli citizens members of "Fraternal Circle".</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the Russians was singer Gregory Leps, whom the U.S. suspected of transporting money to members of the group.</seg>
<seg id="5">In all, the United States lists 22 people as linked to "Fraternal Circle" and six organizations affiliated with it.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nevertheless, many experts have expressed doubt that such an organization exists.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The name 'Fraternal Circle' is more like an attempt to unite the disparate criminal gangs," said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and professor at New York University.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his opinion, "Fraternal Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia".</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had yet to see anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would have confirmed the existence of such criminal organizations," said Mr Galeotti, of the American Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.</seg>
<seg id="10">Liz Shelley, a professor at George Mason University agrees with Mr. Galeotti.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If they act together, then it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization," her words echoing those from the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that "Fraternal Circle" unites in more closely with Russian thief Aslan Usoyana, known as Ded Hasan.</seg>
<seg id="13">The criminal authority was assassinated in January of this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zacharias Kalashova, blacklisted in 2012, were closely connected to Ded Hassan, and another participant on the list, Temuri Mirzoyev, celebrated Ded Hasan's nephew.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless, Mr Galeotti notes that some people on the list have no relationship to Usoyanu.</seg>
<seg id="16">In his opinion, all of them feature more common financial and criminal interests, such as the delivery of drugs from Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="17">Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Gregory Leps - the beloved singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - in "Fraternal Circle" attracted the attention of the Kremlin.</seg>
<seg id="18">Naturally, we hope that we get more detailed information from our American colleagues, in connection with how the decision was made and why he was included in such lists, said a spokesman for the head of state Dmitry Peskov.</seg>
<seg id="19">In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.</seg>

<seg id="3">According to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation said the American might answer questions from representatives of Germany in writing or other means in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The departure of Edward Snowden outside Russia is virtually impossible.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In this case, he will lose the status of a refugee and could be extradited to the United States according to Washington's request", the agency spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"However, in principle, the prosecutor general of the Federal Republic of Germany could send their representatives to Russia or submit written questions to Snowden", the source said, adding that this question should be elaborated on the international level.</seg>

<seg id="12">Snowden lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of the source of Interfax, said his client would cooperate with German investigators, but will decide himself when and how.</seg>
<seg id="13">US citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA in the US, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, then leaked information about secret U.S. intelligence operations on internet surveillance.</seg>

<seg id="1">Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy</seg>
<seg id="2">Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to the fragile driver of economic growth in Russia, consumption.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is primarily a crisis of arrears on unsecured consumer loans and mass layoffs of workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Our main concern now is not that growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lately, it is almost entirely due to consumption, which does not ease turnovers ", said Clemens Column, Goldman Sachs chief economist for Russia, presenting yesterday's overall quarterly report on the Russian economy.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.</seg>
<seg id="7">With inflation at 6 percent, it will be able to meet future consumer demand roughly at the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, however, most likely, they will improve the expenditure on staff.</seg>
<seg id="9">Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages are rising by 10 per cent, while GDP is only 2%, explained Mr. Column.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company experienced a decline in profitability.</seg>
<seg id="11">If it does not rise, it could lead to lay-offs and a rise in unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russian businesses cannot raise salaries, said Barclays capital chief economist for Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.</seg>
<seg id="13">With unemployment near historical lows, competition for workers is high.</seg>
<seg id="14">To lure away or keep employees employers must raise wages.</seg>
<seg id="15">Consumption in Russia and very rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Mr. Fields, because of the extremely high rates on consumer loans this kind of lending does not have a multiplying effect on the economy of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">The benefit to the economy from growing we saw no, the money does not go to the economy, and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments, said economist.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the problem in another - at Goldman Sachs expect growth of delay on unsecured credit.</seg>
<seg id="19">They are mostly not rich, and have nothing to offer as security.</seg>
<seg id="20">Interest rates on such loans are high.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a result, they often do not return, "said Mr. Column.</seg>
<seg id="22">However the second threat to economic growth in Russia is a possible crisis of arrears on unsecured credit.</seg>
<seg id="23">The director of the HSE banking institute Vasily Solodkov now sees signs of growing banking crisis.</seg>
<seg id="24">Small credit organizations without access to cheap resources, which traditional banks have, were forced to raise funds for the population through high interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="25">In response, traditional banks went on the war-path and began to lower lending rates, says the economist.</seg>
<seg id="26">Small credit organizations cannot give loans under the same interest, otherwise they will have negative interest margin.</seg>
<seg id="27">If traditional banks do not abandon dumping, Russia is in a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.</seg>
<seg id="28">The economist believes that the revocation of the licences of several banks in recent weeks is a harbinger of collapse.</seg>
<seg id="29">"By themselves traditional banks can't cope with such a situation: the system of deposit insurance was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," warns head of the institute.</seg>
<seg id="30">But consumption growth will slow and without the crisis of non-payments, believe in the prestigious - because of the refusal of indexing salaries for civil servants and the military, which in the current version of the draft budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">Partially hit consumption will be softened by the freeze tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, reduced inflation).</seg>
<seg id="32">But only partly: if investments do not rise (and the prerequisites for this are not yet - see the certificate), consumption growth still slows, Goldman Sachs is confident.</seg>
<seg id="33">Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital is waiting until he sees the prerequisites for implementation of the pessimistic scenarios.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The main risk is still falling oil prices, he says.</seg>
<seg id="35">In his estimation, the Russian economy will shrink when the cost of oil falls below $90 per barrel.</seg>
<seg id="36">Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank cannot cut interest rates in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="37">There is a paradoxical picture: inflation fell, and banks have been raising rates.</seg>
<seg id="38">This may mean that they did not believe the central bank, transitions its target interest rate for inflation ", said Clemens Column.</seg>
<seg id="39">The policy of the central bank on market rates affects not only the interbank lending rates.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Hopes for the central bank all collapse," praised Clemens Column.</seg>
<seg id="41">The money received by the central bank auctions, banks are not lending to the economy, and to manage its liquidity</seg>
<seg id="42">As soon as the reduced rate, just changing the exchange rate, it means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Sooner or later, the central bank will understand that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Column and reminded that the state plans to ruble float by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="44">But will either have to do this before, or pick up a key central bank rate (5.5%), he says.</seg>
<seg id="45">In his estimation, the ruble is artificially overvalued by 10%.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ruble only one road is weakening, - the expert concludes.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if the central bank in financial system even the shadow of a doubt that the currency is not part of the policy to weaken the currency, it can bring down the ruble is much stronger.</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA: "Air passengers can now use the gadgets on planes (but not to call from your mobile phone)"</seg>
<seg id="2">Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines, published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
<seg id="3">But passengers should not expect change to occur immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">FAA has indicated that airlines will have to show how their planes meet the new guidelines and that they must update their training manuals for members of the flight crew and the rules on the installation of devices to conform to the new guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="6">FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Delta and JetBlue were among airlines which have already submitted plans.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Depending on the condition of the plan we could approve the increased use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA stated.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers are currently required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.</seg>
<seg id="10">They should not restart them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain indicates that it is safe to do so.</seg>
<seg id="11">Passengers should turn off their devices once again when the plane is descends for landing, and not to use them while the plane is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and runway taxi, FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most new airliners and other planes modified so that passengers could use wi-fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura Gleyding, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the change.</seg>
<seg id="15">"After the new policy is safely implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carriers to achieve this), it will be a win-win option," said Gleyding.</seg>
<seg id="16">We frankly are tired of feeling like "cranky schoolteachers" when it comes to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="17">But using the internet connection for web browsing, exchange of electronic mail, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thus, still no "Words with Friends" — the social game which the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when there was a notable case: the actor was ejected from an American airlines flight for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the aircraft was at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">But heavier devices, such as laptops, still need to be stored in the overhead storage compartment because they could injure someone if they were to fly through the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="21">Calls from mobile phones in flight are still banned.</seg>
<seg id="22">Regulatory powers on telephone falls under the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="23">FAA may remove a ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
<seg id="24">Last month Mark Rozenker from the National Council for Transport Safety, the national transport safety expert for CBS news, said that cell phones are still considered a safety risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Cell phones — it really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we know thanks to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers is when the plane is in the air," said Rozenker.</seg>
<seg id="26">An FAA advisory committee created to study this issue, recommended last month that the government allowed the more widespread use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">In recent years, pressure has grown on the FAA, with the aim of easing restrictions on their use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics, such as Democrats Senator from Missouri Claire McCaskill, argue that there is no legitimate reason for the prohibitions related to safety.</seg>
<seg id="29">The restrictions also becomes more difficult to enforce, as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off devices.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA restricted passenger use of electronic devices in 1966, in response to reports of pocket navigation and communications equipment, when some passengers began to wear a FM radio — high-tech gadgets of the time.</seg>
<seg id="32">New airplanes are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they also developed and are approved by FAA as resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines have already offered passengers the use of wifi at cruising altitude for several years.</seg>
<seg id="34">The aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of aircraft adapted for wider use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today's electronic devices typically emit radio signals with much lower power than previous generation devices.</seg>
<seg id="37">Devices for reading electronic books, for example, emit only minimal signals when turning pages.</seg>
<seg id="38">But signals become more powerful when the device downloads or sends data.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among those who pushed for easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices of passengers was the company Amazon.com.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2011 company representatives acquired an airliner to check for problems when using their Kindle devices for reading electronic books, but never found any.</seg>
<seg id="41">FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices presents any risk.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Passengers said he believes distractions from the devices are real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other members of the committee said that there are only individual messages pilots, confirming that the devices might be creating interference for aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAA require pilots be allowed to require passengers to turn off devices during landings and in limited visibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">A group of representatives from the tourism industry welcomed the changes, calling them are a step towards passengers who now use a variety of technological devices.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not inconsistent with safety and protection," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. travel association.</seg>

<seg id="1">New anti-nicotine vaccine may inhibit the process of smoking pleasure</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which could deprive the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
<seg id="4">Further tests are needed before trials on humans, which will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We very much hope that this strategy of using vaccines can finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit using all methods available in the market today, but find their nicotine dependence is too strong to overcome it by using these modern means," said the Cornell professor.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The antibodies trace any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing getting a smoker nicotine high.</seg>
<seg id="9">In tests, vaccinated mice which were later given nicotine continued their normal activities.</seg>
<seg id="10">In mice which were not given the vaccine, researchers observed signs that nicotine later given to the mice reached the brain, researchers say.</seg>
<seg id="11">These experiments were described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, injections were needed so frequently that the process became expensive and impractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it uses liver cells as factories of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccines were completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence.</seg>
<seg id="16">But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from smoking due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them get rid of this habit," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage</seg>
<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for what they bring as hand luggage on board their flight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soft drinks, though their announcement on Wednesday indicated that passengers can leave yourself the whole bank.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new fee applies to hand luggage stored in the overhead storage compartments, however small handheld bags placed under the seat remain free.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is payable in advance, and $100 if travellers pay at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman for Frontier Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee encourages passengers to take care of the payment in advance.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We do not want to charge the higher fee," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airlines began to charge for the first and second bag checked bags in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers, trying to avoid these fees began to make heavier use of more carry-on luggage; as a result of this increased demand, the overhead storage bins often do not have enough space.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fees are one of the ways to make passengers less carry on board.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley said that this new fee is not really about making money.</seg>
<seg id="12">The fact of the matter is that most loyal Frontier clients say that finding a place is the overhead storage compartments have become more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers who bought tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.</seg>
<seg id="14">This means that one passenger in the queue for a Frontier flight might be able to carry a bag for free, while the next customer in the queue could pay $100 for the same bag.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley said that changes to procedures on the website and the Frontier check-in desk are intended to ensure that the passengers will know about the fee before they get to the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">The new Frontier hand baggage fee will not apply until the summer, though the date has yet to be set.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers often complain of fees for baggage and other fees, but airline adore them.</seg>
<seg id="18">They argue that the baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service should pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many on wall street believe the addition of baggage fees enable airlines collect to enough money to cover the costs of air travel after several years of losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">But most of them are not related to the fees for hand luggage.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand baggage fee three years ago and fellow discount carrier Allegiant Air later followed its example.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only other airline in this group is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airlines consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the extra fees.</seg>
<seg id="23">In his assessment of the report from December 2011, Spirit's charge for hand luggage brings in $50 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines senior manager, recently flew on a Spirit flight, and he was wondered what he would find at the gate, where the passengers would face the atypical Spirit fee for hand luggage.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The process of boarding was the smoothest of those that I have seen in my career in the airlines," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plane was full, he said, "and boarding went quickly."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier also follows Spirit with respect to fees at $2 for coffee, tea, soft drinks or juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frontier said that passengers who get soft drinks or juice, can have the whole can and that coffee will be provided free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="30">It will still be handing out free water.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2008 US Airways attempted charging for drinks for a short time, but abandoned this after seven months, after passengers began to complain, and no other major airline not followed its example.</seg>
<seg id="32">With respect to Frontier charging a hand luggage fee when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, it is the latest measure to attract customers to its web site.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines pay online ticket providers such as Orbitz between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
<seg id="34">This gives all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than from online travel agents.</seg>
<seg id="35">But frontier has gone further than others in this area.</seg>
<seg id="36">In september, the airline started to give two times less frequent flier miles to customers who bought tickets through online travel agencies.</seg>
<seg id="37">On wednesday the airline cut the number of frequent flier miles down to 25 percent of the miles travelled.</seg>
<seg id="38">So on a 1,000 mile trip from Frontier, bought from an online travel agency, would earn 250 miles.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.</seg>
<seg id="40">Frontier has the base of loyal customers in its hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming less profitable.</seg>
<seg id="41">Revenue fell 9 percent, and flight opportunities fell by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results announced on Wednesday by its parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
<seg id="42">Republic is trying to rectify the finances of Frontier in the sale of the airline.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents can choose to register intersex children "uncertain" gender</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany became the first European country, which acknowledged a third gender for children born with external sex organs of intermediate type.</seg>
<seg id="3">It will no longer be necessary to attribute a male or female gender to newborns.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new law does not require parents to determine the gender of such children, allowing parents to register the gender as "indefinite" or "unidentified" in their birth certificates.</seg>
<seg id="5">The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents that can result in quick decisions about surgery for assigning gender to the newborn, and counter discrimination against intersex people.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the BBC, one intersex person said many years later: "I am not a man and not a woman."</seg>
<seg id="7">I am a doctor's patchwork product of bruises and scars.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every year, roughly one in two thousand children is neither boy nor girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">These intersex persons have one of approximately 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual development disorders" — the collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed external sex organs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gender identification is still not understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign a gender than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if it happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="12">New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law "sounds like a good idea."</seg>
<seg id="13">Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgical intervention, but the majority of children is do not present them," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">You can assign gender without surgery and then see how personality develops.</seg>
<seg id="16">The science of how the child will develop a gender identity is not too accurate.</seg>
<seg id="17">No one can answer questions about why this is happening.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is a mystery, why people are homosexual.</seg>
<seg id="19">The report sent to the european commission in 2011, describes intersex people as distinct from transgender or transsexual because their condition relates not to gender, but to their biological structure which does not correspond to solely either male or female sex, and but rather has characteristics typical of both sexes or of neither.</seg>
<seg id="20">These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual symptoms such as muscle mass, hair distribution cover, chest and physique; primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and gonads.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report also gives a general idea about the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crime based on prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="22">Children with gender variations now have a special category.</seg>
<seg id="23">Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register as male, female or "third gender" in its official documents.</seg>
<seg id="24">In june, a 52-year-old resident of Australia Norri May-Uelbi became the first person in the world to be acknowledged in court to have the right to maintain "undetermined" sexual status for life.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, German passports will mark the third gender, in addition to M or F — X for intersex.</seg>
<seg id="26">In neighboring france, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on the TV channel France 24.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, a deeply Catholic country, signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="28">American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is involved in a new state, where gender is a matter of choice, and sexual activity — no, we still stand for these two pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">One mother of a newborn baby from the state of Maryland also announced that she would have gender specified for children at birth.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is difficult enough to raise a child, and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child," said the web site for parents.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and confidence.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, children born with male and female reproductive organs were called hermaphrodites — after the handsome greek god who had signs of both sexes.</seg>
<seg id="33">And yet just ten years ago the medical community described gender as a sheet on which we can all erase and then draw again.</seg>
<seg id="34">But now many are questioning the ethical justification for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes makes the wrong choice, not knowing how the child's assigned gender will match as the child grows.</seg>
<seg id="35">"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called'an urgent psychiatric case'," Drescher said.</seg>
<seg id="36">When these children were born, you didn't ring the psychiatrist — you rang the surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The dominant theory about how to treat children with intermediate genital type, was proposed by Mr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easily amenable to change.</seg>
<seg id="38">He introduced into circulation, the term "gender identity" and argued that the signals of the environment, including social signals — from parents to the child — interact with genes and the child's hormones in determining whether a person is considered to be a male or female.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in one case of 1966, known as "John / Joan", his theories were called into question.</seg>
<seg id="40">He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during a botched circumcision, that the child also be castrated, removing his testicles, and raise him as a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Mani presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but this was not the case," said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="42">When he was about 15 years old, he became a little boy again and married to a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">But after 38 years, he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">Drescher said that today some doctors are still "apply this model."</seg>
<seg id="45">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the internet, people who survived the sex change operation for declared themselves "dissatisfied with the result."</seg>
<seg id="46">Such was the case of Jim Bruce, a writer from the state of Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but genitalia of intermediate type.</seg>
<seg id="47">Doctors could not accurately determine whether he had a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live "a life of a man."</seg>
<seg id="48">However shortly after his birth in 1976 Bruce's external sexual organ and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">He began to take female hormones at the age of 12 years.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I knew that I was not a girl," he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="52">After 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But after suffering from depression and understanding that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">What he learned, it was terrible.</seg>
<seg id="55">I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about this.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development, which kept his body from producing enough testosterone to enable normal genital development.</seg>
<seg id="57">After learning the truth, he again became a man, taking testosterone injections and removing his breasts.</seg>
<seg id="58">The procedure made him sterile.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today, he works in defense of others in the organization called the Interface Project, trying to bring the perception of intersex people into normal view.</seg>
<seg id="60">But Ann Temar-Mettis, executive director of the California association Legal Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "urges labeling and stigma."</seg>
<seg id="61">"Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to take a hasty decision and give the child an "uncertain gender", she said.</seg>
<seg id="62">We are afraid that this will contribute to intervention.</seg>
<seg id="63">We believe that it is better to assign male or female gender, then to wait.</seg>
<seg id="64">But we have not seen this law in action, so all we can do is make suppositions.</seg>
<seg id="65">Temar-Mettis said her organization supports the Australian law, because "it allows adults to make choice in favor of the third gender."</seg>
<seg id="66">"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their official sex," she says.</seg>
<seg id="67">German law implies its assigned at birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is a battle which small children should not enter at this stage.</seg>
<seg id="69">When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr Arlin Baratz, a specialist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law "supports" parents, as well as children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a sexual development disorder called "complete androgen insensitivity syndrome."</seg>
<seg id="72">Because her angrogen receptors work incorrectly, Katie has developed female characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="73">She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Now, at 29, Katie is married and studies pediatric psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.</seg>
<seg id="75">Despite the fact that she is barren, she hopes to become a parent via adoption or having gestational surrogate motherhood.</seg>
<seg id="76">"The law gives parents the time not to take any hasty decisions themselves," Baratz said.</seg>
<seg id="77">It gives them time to do any analysis or understand the situation, as well as a period of time before they write "male" or "female."</seg>
<seg id="78">In this case you in order — baby love child.</seg>
<seg id="79">You have a lovely child, and you feel joy.</seg>
<seg id="80">We do not need to do the operation quickly, which is irreversible.</seg>
<seg id="81">"It allows children to participate in solving and eliminates the worry that is driven by parents, because they do not feel that doing the right thing, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the end the child decides what gender feels more comfortable for him or her — and that's fine.</seg>
<seg id="83">This gives children the opportunity to decide on their own.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts at equestrian events gathered in Cardiff to fight for the prized "Horse of the year" knew that competition would be very high.</seg>
<seg id="2">However, no one was prepared for the emergence of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.</seg>
<seg id="3">Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before he took his first steps, this baby with his pet Shetland pony, Toffy, a lynx breezed through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Nerazluchnaya pair — the same height — has received high marks for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is held in the central city of equestrian sport, Sunnybank Radri, near Cardiff.</seg>
<seg id="5">Leaving a general review to the background of men and women in elegant livery, he shifted his Nabekren Kepku and proudly guided around the two-year Toffy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The judges praised Fenton for his innate ability with horses, which was not developed over years.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, Toffy received the highest score for appearance and character.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fenton was given Toffy on his third birthday in March of last year, and since then he has worked with the Shetland pony every day.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother, Donna, also said: "Fenton and Toffy make a beautiful pair. "</seg>
<seg id="10">They had a lot of rivals, but these two have gone with a gold cup and Rozochkoy.</seg>
<seg id="11">This was only his second performance with Toffy, and we were all delighted when he won.</seg>
<seg id="12">Total strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to have a picture taken with him.</seg>
<seg id="13">This boy from the village that lies near Ebbwyl in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Cowells, which has showed horses for more than 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ms. Cowells said: "All of the audience was stunned, and all chanted, gasped, cheered, and waved."</seg>
<seg id="15">He ran on the sand along the entire length of the arena and, although he looked tiny, he perfectly made his case.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fenton is crazy about animals — he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens that he cares for.</seg>
<seg id="17">Judging by how he started, soon he will take part in "Horse of the Year "— and I am confident that he will play well.</seg>
<seg id="18">A spokesman for the annual horse fair said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his pony."</seg>
<seg id="19">Together they are a great team.</seg>
<seg id="20">The judges remarked on Fenton and Toffy for their appearance, and for the way they presented themselves at the show ring.</seg>
<seg id="21">They value coherence of ponies and their breeders, and Fenton and Toffy were best in the ring.</seg>
<seg id="22">I am confident that Fentonu helped him look attractive in the outfit; he was really good in his role.</seg>

<seg id="1">Court suspends the execution of the ruling on the practice of Stop and Frisk at the New York Police Department</seg>
<seg id="2">On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended enforcement of a court order demanding changes to the "Stop and Frisk" program of the New York Police Department, and the judge dismissed the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">The United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals judge Sheindlin Shiry said that execution of decisions will be suspended pending the results of an appeal filed against the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">In August, a judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how it carried out the program for street detention and questioning.</seg>
<seg id="5">The city appealed the decision and the resolution on corrective measures, including a requirement to appoint the controller to help the police to change work practices and related training programs.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard oral statements on the request to suspend the case.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Court of Appeal said there is a need to remove judges because they violated the code of conduct for United States judges courts with the need to avoid demonstrations of bias, in part because of a series of interviews with the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unnecessarily weighted against blacks and Hispanics in the "Stop and Frisk" program.</seg>
<seg id="9">It has appointed external controller to oversee the far-reaching changes, which include reforms to the policies, training, and monitoring, and also agreed to launch a pilot program for testing Zakreplyaemykh on-body cameras at the police precincts where a majority of arrests take place.</seg>
<seg id="10">In August, New York decided to cease the practice of storing the names and addresses of people, cases in which were stopped after a police investigation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Debate on the city's appeal should be held after march 14, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The tactic of stopping and searching" was criticised by many civil rights lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stop and Frisk "was practiced for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching in 2011 in a record 684,330 people, most of whom are black and Hispanic.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2004, four people, all — representatives of national minorities, filed a class action in court.</seg>
<seg id="15">Supporters of the changes to the "Stop and Frisk" program at the New York Police Department say that these changes will end unfair practice, provide a more reliable and effective police service, and could affect how other police departments carry out the practice.</seg>
<seg id="16">Opponents argue that the change undermines the morale of the police, not the crime rate, would lead to unnecessary expenditure of money, and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions for the police due to the reduced number of officers by several thousand over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="17">The judge noted that it did not stop the practice of "Stop and Frisk," which complies with the constitution, but changes the way New York police stops people.</seg>

<seg id="1">Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in commodity prices after the signing of the association with the European Union</seg>
<seg id="2">The prime minister of Ukraine, Mykola Azarov, is convinced that prices will fall significantly in the country after the country signs the association agreement with the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="3">He stated this in the course of the chat with readers on his facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="4">I can definitely say that prices are determined by a number of factors, including customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="5">So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions on the free trade area, the level of customs duties on the import of goods from the EU will decrease significantly.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this will mean that prices have to fall.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is with regard to goods that come from EU countries, "Azarov wrote.</seg>
<seg id="8">As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct; will be indirect.</seg>
<seg id="9">But, nevertheless, there should not also be a rise in prices.</seg>
<seg id="10">So the message of the many billboards that have lately appeared in our country, that association with the EU is rising prices, it is not quite so. Or, to be more precise, not so "wrote Aazarov.</seg>

<seg id="1">$325 Million rescue package for Tasmanian healthchare</seg>
<seg id="2">The federal government insists that the bailout package of $325 million for Tasmania's weakened health systems will be accompanied by strict conditions that guarantee that the state wastes no money.</seg>
<seg id="3">Federal minister for health Tanya Plibersek announced that the commonwealth is taking "urgent steps" to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
<seg id="4">A decision on funding over four years was declared after government consultations with Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The government proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which, we believe, will solve specific problems facing the state," ms. Plibersek said today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The package of $325 million includes $31 million for planned operations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and surgery to remove cataracts, will help to overcome the backlog.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is also money for hospitals that accept patients without reservation, in Hobart and Lonsestone, to improve the quality of in-patient care, training medical professionals, mental health services and implementation of electronic systems of personal health cards in local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This investment will go to advanced doctors to allow for the implementation of ideas about how best to help the Tasmanian health system," said ms. Plibersek.</seg>
<seg id="10">The minister insisted that the government of Tasmania will operate with strict accountability and responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive cash from the commonwealth, and produce monthly reports about where these additional funds are spent.</seg>
<seg id="12">A three person commission will be created to make sure the state provides services as efficiently and more effectively.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will solve nothing "unless it comes with genuine reforms, which would put the health care system of Tasmania on a more sustainable track."</seg>
<seg id="14">Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first turned to the prime minister in early May.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I hope that the package of federal aid will significantly contribute to removing the health care system of this state from critical condition," said Mr. Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the state government, these additional sampling procedures largely compensate for recent cuts.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the federal opposition spokesman on health, Peter Datton believes that today's statement represents "a similar solution."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The reason we are here is that the state's Labor government squandered $430 million from the health system," he told the television network ABC TV.</seg>
<seg id="19">When the government of the state is spending nearly half a billion dollars, and the commonwealth invests 300 million, you cannot pretend that this is good news.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr. Datton asked ms. Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar from the rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

<seg id="6">Nathaniel Morris p. - a second year student at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
<seg id="7">I read a terribly sad book recently.</seg>
<seg id="8">I thought that this book would inspire me in times of gloom during the second year of medical school and restore in me a sense of hope.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is called "The Audacity to Win", a memoir about the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I retire from my evening of writing reports on patients and go to bed, this book brings me back to the time when policy inspired millions of people, and performances could capture the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Victory in the election was formidable, and leading news programs paused for reflection on this historical moment.</seg>

<seg id="13">The White House was won by young team of strategists and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
<seg id="14">When Obama got into office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.</seg>
<seg id="15">Then I close the book.</seg>
<seg id="16">The return to the present is a rude awakening, like waking from a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="18">During the years that have passed since I cast his first ballot, changes actually did occur.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was more than I could even have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="20">I give Obama credit for his large and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable medical care, to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the repeal of "don't ask, not tell", the killing of Osama Bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, I believe that the party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the public health option and the closure of the base in Guantanamo, among others.</seg>
<seg id="22">But after an innumerable number of times, when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I could not provide further explanation.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have reached the point of political desperation.</seg>
<seg id="24">Republican obstructionism could not explain the permission to spy on foreign leaders or ordering military strikes on innocent children in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">He could not explain the collection of data about the private lives of americans, the national security agency or persecution of those exposing government misconduct.</seg>
<seg id="26">He could not explain the murder of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Aulaqi without a trial or failure to comply with the limits of public financing and spending during the presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="27">He cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that the White House efforts to silence the media, are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."</seg>
<seg id="28">And lately he cannot justify the fact that he cannot develop a simple website within more than three years since signing the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
<seg id="29">I do not know what I should have expected.</seg>
<seg id="30">Should I have understood at the age of 18 years that a leader may contradict the political campaigns that precede him?</seg>
<seg id="31">It is obvious that work on an election campaign is not predictable programme of action, because our public dialogue will form the opposition political party and random events such as the carnage in Newtown will occur.</seg>
<seg id="32">Yet all the examples listed above examples were largely the administration's own choices.</seg>
<seg id="33">And that is what bothers me the most.</seg>
<seg id="34">I voted for obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney was a strange and crass alternative, it seemed that he was not in a position to make a decision on his own policies or views.</seg>
<seg id="36">I thought that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections delivers hope, about which we have heard for so long.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, when Obama's approval rating fell below 45 percent this week, to return to 2008 through this book has become much more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1">The first freely elected president in Egypt is sworn in</seg>
<seg id="2">Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of celebrations is unlikely to be the end of the political struggle in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="3">Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when taking his oath, becoming the first freely elected president of the country, having replaced Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">At his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court, Morsi also became the first freely elected islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">He took the oath before 18 judges in black in the court on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a ceremony shown live on state television.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life — absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, an engineer with an American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, the fundamentalist group which was a banned organization for most of the 84 years of its existence, and a target for tough action by successive governments.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived with a small group shortly after 11 a.m. local time.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the court building to greet the new president, and, unlike the presidential fanfare since Mubarak, traffic was stopped only for a short period of time to drive his convoy on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although Morsi ridiculed as "spare wheel" "brothers", his personal prestige has soared since his victory and friday's speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for islamists, but also all those who want to bring the matter before the end of the 2011 uprising against Mubarak's authoritarian rule.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi said, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to judges in wood panelled halls where he took the oath of office.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was provided with the official reception with the army orchestra playing the national anthem during which he stood by the "quiet."</seg>
<seg id="14">Field marshal Hussein Tantawi, a military figure, arrived.</seg>
<seg id="15">His arrival was greeted with the slogan "the army and the people are one hand," chanted by hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.</seg>
<seg id="16">Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of islamist student groups.</seg>
<seg id="17">Morsi took a symbolic oath on friday in Tahrir square, where the uprising began, Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowing to reclaim presidential powers, which his office was deprived of the military council that has made the case against the deposed leader.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by agreeing to take the oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he performs the will of the military, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">Morsi's speech in Tahrir square was filled with theatre with populist gestures.</seg>

<seg id="2">School English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and modern British fiction since 1914.</seg>
<seg id="3">The exam will also be presented "programme texts" to encourage broader reading.</seg>
<seg id="4">The combining English literature and language will be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="5">From 2015 onward, pupils will be obliged to take a final examination in language, with a strongly reccomended choice of English literature as a separate exam.</seg>

<seg id="7">It will make changes in other key subjects in the following year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Separately, the regulator of qual exams will present a revised structure of high school exams, with the new system, assessment and less course work.</seg>
<seg id="9">Speaking in the summer, education minister Michael Gouv said that they had "reached a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence", insisting that the school final examinations will be "more complex, more ambitious and more rigorous."</seg>
<seg id="10">Research shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours per week in the quarter) than most other countries do.</seg>
<seg id="11">For comparison — the Australian schools devote an average of 143 hours per year, and in Singapore, pupils are engaged in about 138 hours.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although not formally requiring that more time in the schedule will be spent on mathematics, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school final examinations in mathematics, in combination with an increased coefficient table ratings, will likely serve as an incentive to give schools extra training on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the curriculums, more attention will be paid to "the tasks of real life" including financial mathematics.</seg>

<seg id="3">According to the federal service for the protection of the constitution (BFV), the German domestic intelligence service, its mission was to photograph the roof of the building, which is located less than 5 km from the European central bank and the Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="4">German media say the BFV had hoped to discover the intelligence listening devices, and these actions led to the talks between the US and the ministry of foreign affairs of Germany in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Klapper, director of national intelligence, in September, again promised that the United States will not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits.

<seg id="6">But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a goverment whistleblower — began to publish the treasury intelligence secrets to the United States, European governments and executives are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports that the U.S. national security agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to the data stored in the cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoia of corporations, persecution by the state, to new heights.</seg>

<seg id="4">He said a new judicial authority on media "will always be partisan, since it is a continuation of the government", and restrictions on the content and advertising would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the members of parliament," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the newspaper the Star, the new law essentially allows the government to "take a stranglehold over the media," and the standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "received a serious blow" and attacked the bill as "draconian."</seg>
<seg id="7">The adoption of the draft law is part of measures taken to enhance national security after the September attacks by muslim terrorists in the Westgate shopping centre.</seg>

<seg id="1">After accusations of poor taste, Eugenia Vasilieva is talking</seg>
<seg id="2">Eugenia Vasilieva, a person who captured almost a year of media attention, has still never addressed numerous publications in the press about her embezzlement in the ministry of defence, as well as about her personal relationship with former defense anatoly, and about her love of poetry and valuable things.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, on 1 November, she broke the silence on the Figurantka case.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an interview with Life News Vasiliev said: "originally, of course, the task was exactly one: me out of any negative information in respect of the former defense minister.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was blackmail on the subject that I must testify otherwise I would be imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="6">Today, these threats have stopped.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then we will go to court and prove his innocence.</seg>
<seg id="8">We are 100 percent confident that we will win.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the time of the interview, you can conclude that, perhaps, Vasilieva was most outraged by words about how she had no taste.</seg>
<seg id="10">This probably refers to the statement by the official representative of the RF Vladimir Markyn about what is in the collections of paintings, which were seized when the Figurantka forgery case surfaced.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among the seized property were a number of paintings which the hostess, being confident in their great artistic value, acquired as masterpieces of world art.</seg>
<seg id="12">But historical examinations by investigators after the seizure of these paintings, found that they have no artistic value and, frankly speaking, are cheap counterfeits, "said Markin in early October.</seg>
<seg id="13">None of the paintings were stolen from the ministry of defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then, having acknowledged that they were not stolen from the ministry of defence, he told me that I have bad taste.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss any personal matters?</seg>
<seg id="16">In my opinion, this is simply an outrage, "says Vasiliev.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the same time, the question of whether she admits her guilt although in one of her 12 accountable criminal episodes, Vasilyev said: "of course not.</seg>
<seg id="18">I admit to nothing at all.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation concerned.</seg>
<seg id="20">Simply stop misleading people, once and for all.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, in response to today's announcement of the RF IC that Vasilieva shies away from the study of the materials of the criminal case, Figurantka's lawyer said that he and his client "were not given access to the documents in the case by the investigator.</seg>
<seg id="22">What was the cause of the revelations under house arrest - still not enough to satisfy the press?</seg>
<seg id="23">Perhaps not as a woman, she failed to respond to the accusation of bad taste?</seg>
<seg id="24">Or right journalists "Komsomolki" Utverzhdavshie a couple of days ago that she "weighing in on an even bigger trance" under house arrest because of news about reconciliation, Anatoly Serdyukov, with his wife and his return to the bosom of the family?</seg>
<seg id="25">The famous military observer "KP" Victor Huperzia in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "investigators do not rule out that after such turmoil it may become more razgovorchivoy" interrogation.</seg>
<seg id="26">Earlier Vasilieva some accusations of illegal sale of ministry of defence property took upon themselves.</seg>

<seg id="7">The same photo is used in a Photoshop tutorial, published on the Russian web site "Megaobzor" on 18 January 2011.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, it is already used in advertising for RugGear smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic banknote featured the Sine-Goluboy mountain range.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the one side, a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other side, views of the Olympic stadium and the firebird.</seg>
<seg id="11">The designer of the banknotes, Paul Bushuev, won in a competition among students of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts named repin.</seg>
<seg id="12">The presentation noted that it considered a few sports - skiing, freestyle skiing and ski jumping - but eventually opted for snowboarding, because it is a relatively young sport.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to a Izvestia source, close to the central bank, the regulator is not indifferent to public opinion regarding the wide dissemination of images of the Olympic snowboarder banknotes and are investigating the situation.</seg>
<seg id="14">And here Goznake is not too worried about the commotion around the Olympic notes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Gosznaka's press secretary Natalia Nikiforova told "Izvestiyam" that all the discussion about plagiarism is funny.</seg>
<seg id="16">The snowboarder is pointed to the right in the photos on the web - to the left - detailed Nikiforova.</seg>
<seg id="17">The man in the photo was shot from different points for creating the banknotes, then the final images was selected because it is a characteristic pose of a snowboarder.</seg>
<seg id="18">It also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic bill, as the artist received a salary for the job.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to experts, the debate around the image on the Olympic bill is good.</seg>
<seg id="20">The image on the banknote is a plus for her promotion, said executive director of "Rusbrend" Alexey Popovichev.</seg>
<seg id="21">To prove 100 percent similarity of the images on the banknote and Fotobankakh is quite difficult, however, questions about the claims of intellectual property in this image are unlikely to come.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first Olympic bill appeared in China - the Olympic games in Beijing in 2008 released a commemorative banknote in 10 yuan.</seg>
<seg id="23">Russia has decided to support this tradition.</seg>

<seg id="1">The "Rosbalt" agency was stripped of media status for foul language</seg>
<seg id="2">31 October Mosgorsud decided to void the license of the registration agency "Rosbalt", writes "Ribbon".</seg>
<seg id="3">The deprivation of media agency status insisted Roskomnadzor - for the systematic and gross violations of the law on mass media.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the process, it has created an unpleasant precedent: the court considered it possible to close media that, in fact is denying the right to promote counter-arguments.</seg>
<seg id="5">What is "Rosbalt"</seg>
<seg id="6">UAB "Rosbalt" news agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">In subsequent years, the agency has opened a second headquarters in Moscow and a number of regional offices.</seg>
<seg id="8">The agency also has offices in the countries of the former Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since 2001, "Rosbalt" developed and functioned as a federal information-analysis agency.</seg>
<seg id="10">By the mid 2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private online media organizations in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, "Rosbalt" has always held a rather specific niche: the nucleus of exclusive agency publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in the law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talk about the proximity of the security sectors continued throughout the existence of the agency.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, "Rosbalt" had an extensive base of sources in various departments, supporting such assumptions and implying that the project was led by Natalia Chaplin - the wife of Viktor Cherkesov.</seg>
<seg id="14">Whether Chaplin held a leadership role at "Rosbalt" until the end is not clear: she is often referred to as a "project leader".</seg>
<seg id="15">The director general of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the chief editor is Nikolay Ulyanov.</seg>
<seg id="16">Recently "Rosbalt" featured in the ratings of federal media - neither on the quote, nor the audience.</seg>
<seg id="17">In October, the agency took 25th place in the traffic ratings of Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the data from LiveInternet, srednesutochnaya traffic to rosbalt.ru site is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - around three million unique visitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">Among the most popular materials over the past five months, notes about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist "group king and jester" pogroms in the metropolitan biryuleve.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conflict between "Rosbalt" and Roskomnadzorom began in July 2013, when enforcement of amendments to the law on the mass media started, which banned journalists from using foul language.</seg>
<seg id="21">The office found the forbidden vocabulary in two articles published on the website of the agency ("Dzhigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot Oskvernili Oil Rigs").</seg>
<seg id="22">Further hand describe differently.</seg>
<seg id="23">On the basis of the discovered video, Roskomnadzor accused "Rosbalt" of gross and systematic violations of the law on mass media and turned to the courts to deprive the agency of the license.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Rosbalt" stated that claims departments nepravomerny: first, the videos were not redaktsionnymi materials, secondly, foul words in them were masked, and thirdly, immediately after warnings the videos were removed from the site.</seg>
<seg id="25">The agency appealed the Roscomnadzor court claims - and on 22 October 2013 Mosgorsud took action Roscomnadzor, consideration of these complaints still continued.</seg>
<seg id="26">But already the world number 25, the judge ruled in favor of "Rosbalt": chief editor Nicholas Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offences and was fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.</seg>
<seg id="27">Obviously, this is the outcome of the hearing and predreshilo Mosgorsude - if refuse from the idea that the outcome would be a foregone conclusion even earlier.</seg>
<seg id="28">On october 31, the court decided to allow the invalidation of certificate of registration for "Rosbalt", effectively blocking media agency status.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is not to say that "Rosbalt" remained alone during this confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="30">The agency supported the state duma deputies (a statement in the name of the head of Roscomnadzor Alexandra Zharova signed on 10 October by 26 deputies; the document was filed on the initiative of the communist party).</seg>
<seg id="31">About the closure of publications that claimed the head of the Russian journalists union Vsevolod Bogdanov, president of the Moscow Journalists Union Pavel Gusev and head of the Presidential Council on hHman Rights, Mikhail Fedotov.</seg>
<seg id="32">Moreover, according to Bogdanova, Roscomnadzor leadership even gave him any guarantees that up to revocation of the license deal is not reached.</seg>
<seg id="33">The trial of "Rosbalt" showed: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be a means of mass media in Russia today is the big question.</seg>

<seg id="1">Speech Gene Stimulated Synapse Formation</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Hospital-New York Medical School found the protein that allows the Foxp2 "speech gene" to carry out its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.</seg>
<seg id="3">The study is published in the journal Science, you can read his summary on their website.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly associated with speech.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's role was established in 2001, thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not utter words correctly and sometimes could not even understand each other.</seg>
<seg id="6">Researchers found that family members have a disrupted Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function was not known.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the new study, the biologists have shown that at least part of the function of Foxp2 is to stimulate formation of new synapses in the part of the brain associated with formation of speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">It does this with another gene, SRPX2.</seg>
<seg id="9">The latest discoverty was made during the search for the factors that encourage the formation of synapses.</seg>
<seg id="10">SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes, the authors found, but it was only activated via Foxp2.</seg>
<seg id="11">What SRPX2 really affects is vocalization, scientists confirmed in experiments on mice.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the animal's gene activation was artificially reduced, they cried less at the separation from their mother.</seg>
<seg id="13">If the activation of the gene is restored, it restores the frequency of the sounds.</seg>
<seg id="14">Previously the mice also showed a link between the vocalization and Foxp2.</seg>
<seg id="15">The animals, which included a copy of the human gene pishchali activated and at a lower frequency than normal mice.</seg>
<seg id="16">Until now, however, scientists did not know what the function of Foxp2 was and, accordingly, state-steered them with the SRPX2 purely "mechanical" properties of education sounds or thinner processes.</seg>

<seg id="17">Citizens throughout the world, as well as senior officials — including the United States — have found the exposé of an unregulated system of ubiquitous surveillance useful to society.</seg>
<seg id="18">The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with German authorities, "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."</seg>

<seg id="2">The European Union has a contingency plan to ensure Ukraine gas, and also to reach an agreement with the IMF about an emergency loan, if Russia would take any action in response to the possible signing of the association agreement between the EU and Ukraine on the Vilnius summit.</seg>
<seg id="3">Negotioans are under way with the iMF for a stand-by loan, but another EU official, directly involved in the negotiations, added that their goal is the conclusion of the agreement in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can get 610 million euros from the European Union itself.</seg>

<seg id="10">The next milestone is the middle of November: by this time the OPCW and Syria must agree to a detailed plan of destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: the gap with Europe gives Scotts choice</seg>
<seg id="2">Another day, another strike on independence.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time, we warn that an independent Scotland should join the European free movement area as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's the same stories about passport control in Bervike and barbed wire along the border of Adrianova shaft.</seg>
<seg id="5">True, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to possible economic benefits from the more liberal movements in the rest of Europe, though — predictably — not that it has appeared in headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">Also, one does not need to point out that the EU member states spend a lot of time to turn their formal rules as it is convenient.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because Scotland is not included in the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance with the requirements will become a cheap concession to Brussels in return for what he truly wanted from the Scots.</seg>
<seg id="8">So this story is not one worthy of attention.</seg>
<seg id="9">This story is so old that she has become a fossil: I first heard "duck" about what "independence means passport control," at least 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet there is an interesting point lost on pereskaze ancient tales.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why should an independent scotland comply with orders in Europe?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why change the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is real european news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe finally stalled.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Evrokrizisom project "Europe" is officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">Across the European Union the party opposed to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a single currency is gaining strength.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany, "Euro-skeptics party alternative for Germany, founded only this year — appeared from nowhere and won nearly five million votes in the September federal election, thus displacing essentially" free democrats "(the equivalent of" our ") liberal democrats, from the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was always the internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.</seg>
<seg id="19">Austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of the common currency have led many people to believe that the project "Europe" has gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The euro crisis is connected with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits — this was true only for Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact Evrosistema blocked its members on favorable exchange rates, for German exporters, and that is what German politicians want to preserve.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, Southern Europe is at a disadvantage in advance of production capacities in comparison with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only means of spasitelnoe is to cut wages and government spending that are actively supported by Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">For the current budget problems and exchange is a much deeper problem of the productive capacities of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of measures to "green" energy, embedded Brussels subsidies — a cipher for French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="26">This paralizuyushche adverse price terms, as we have already seen in greyndzhmute.</seg>
<seg id="27">Freezing wages in the world does not stop overwhelming victory of cheap shale gas in the United States over the European petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result a rebellion is brewing, especially in France, once the most storonnitse EU.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on one level with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Berlin no longer needed Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy and has already imposed its own economic policy of Europe leaving the destroyed the economy of France in distress.</seg>
<seg id="31">The result — the Right acting against the EU Party Marine le Pen of the National Front "just won the decisive run-off election by discarding the ruling party of socialists into third place.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The Front Line" is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote — a timely warning to the British that it would not proceed from the assumption that the split among the right automatically means favor of the left.</seg>
<seg id="33">What makes le Pen with their newly inherited popularity among french white working class?</seg>
<seg id="34">She wants to use the elections to the EU in the next year to create a bloc in the European parliament against the EU and against the single currency.</seg>
<seg id="35">If — and it is very likely — opposition to EU parties will receive support in this election, this unit will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the European parliament.</seg>
<seg id="36">Here is my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The EU will not go away, but becomes something of a "vague Europe (sovereign) nations," which like General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and several economies dependent on it can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore its own currency.</seg>
<seg id="39">I assume that Britain distances herself from the project, hoping to get closer to the US.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, the growing interest from Washington to the Pacific Ocean indicates the likelihood that Britain will be left without attention into the cold Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="41">In what position does that leave Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can choose to become a region (essentially) of England</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send Berlin and Brussels to Hell in a handbasket.</seg>
<seg id="44">I suspect that Scotland can succeed in the freer European agreement provided that we will keep its currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Cooperation with other stranami-edinomyshlennikami will be easier in europe nefederalnoy nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of Norway and preserve our economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">The government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is — ironically — the most successful political movement in Europe, and against the austerity measures, which received a majority of the votes in 2011 due to objections against cuts proposed (and sold) labour chancellor exchequer aleister darlingom and subsequently raised by the coalition of tories and liberal democrats.</seg>
<seg id="48">Scotland would be ludicrous now to vote for independence, only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">Early puberty: aging earlier</seg>
<seg id="2">Afro-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, studies show.</seg>
<seg id="3">Physical changes do not mean that have completed puberty.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the mechanisms of early puberty</seg>
<seg id="6">The trend toward early puberty is not so pronounced in boys</seg>
<seg id="7">Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mothers were asked if they noticed whether their daughter had begin to form breasts and pubic hair growth at 7 or 8 years old?</seg>
<seg id="9">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitts explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I spend a lot of time calming parents — usually it does not mean the rapid advance of full sexual maturity," said Kaplovitts.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts and pubic hair appear earlier in girls.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there is only a slight shift in the age of menustration (first period) over the last four decades.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and decreased compared with 12.75 years in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"After breasts begin to develop, is at least two to three years before menustration", — said Kaplovitts, who is also the author of "Early Puberty In Girls: How To Cope With This Widespread Problem."</seg>
<seg id="15">Time is the most accurate check of how puberty will advance.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is debate about what constitutes an active sexual maturity, but is considered "premature" when breast increase is accompanied by a sharp rise in growth to 8 years.</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases, the process will slow and the pediatrician can monitor carefully.</seg>
<seg id="18">More rapid progress can serve as the basis for endocrologist analysis to avoid serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which ultimately can lead to slow growth and low growth in adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy is based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kaplovitts is cautious with drugs, but acknowledges that the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers. "</seg>
<seg id="23">Another big problem is clear: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They worry about the risks of pregnancy, or even about how they cope with hygiene issues," said Kaplovitts.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was a shock," recalls one woman, her daughter started menstruation when she was 10 years old.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.</seg>
<seg id="27">She came home from school, scared and distraught that it first happened among her friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are many razreklamirovannykh theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is no consistent evidence to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual statements in the media.</seg>
<seg id="30">Boys — like girls, experience puberty earlier.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplovitts argues that the premise which has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years old which correlated the amount of body fat with the onset of puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country, Afro-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are various explanations.</seg>
<seg id="36">There is widespread notions that early puberty is apparently affected by everything including economic conditions, climate change, and genetics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Another mystery: although boys have hair on the face and their body at younger ages, the trend to completing sexual maturity is not as pronounced as in girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other physicians participating in the conference of the AAP confirmed the complexity of this subject.</seg>
<seg id="39">The emergence of pimples and pubic hair is found even in infants and children of nursing age.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We must be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Laurence Silverman, child endocrologist at Children's Hospital at Gorieb G. Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from a pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It may mean an earlier than expected conversation," Kaplovitts.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you keep calm, your child normally reacts well.</seg>
<seg id="44">Especially for girls that blossom early, they need assurance that this process is a normal part of life.</seg>

<seg id="2">At pawnshops at the Bendemir shopping mall in singapore, Dzhanani Amirtkhalinga pawns a golden bracelet, a ring and earrings to pay for his daughter's education.</seg>

<seg id="4">Although she earns s$ 3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator, and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, demand in various parts of southeast Asia — where household debt is growing — is high at Valuemax, where she takes the deal this week, which has became the third pawnbroker registered on the Singapore Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Credit for pawned jewellery is not just a quick way to get money (s $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirtkhalinga), but is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>

<seg id="10">After five years of robust growth following the global financial crisis, cheap credit and Podpityvavshikhsya's loose monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers to compensate for the decrease in revenues with the slowing growth of their economies.</seg>

<seg id="20">In Thailand, the largest operator of pawn shops, Easymoney, observed an increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.</seg>
<seg id="21">Growth in pawnbrokers' business is such that Valuemax, operator of the Bendemire pawn shop and 15 other similar shops in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside of Asia, too, says Yeakh Lee Ching, the executive director of Valuemax.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company will finance the expansion with 60 per cent of s$ 66 million raised this week as a result of putting shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="23">While some lenders have sparked the ire of critics because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeakh says that not only do pawn shops offer cheaper rates than other lenders, they also do not increase debt directly.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Clients hock items that they already own, and monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households," she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hocking wins wider public recognition as a means to obtain short-term secured funding.</seg>
<seg id="26">And pawn shops benefitted not only from those categories of people who are in a precarious financial position.</seg>
<seg id="27">Rich people in Singapore also use Valuemax, hocking gold ingots or a Rolex, which can yield up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
<seg id="28">We are seeing clients from all sectors of society.</seg>
<seg id="29">"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short period of time for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary financial difficulties," said Ms. Yeakh.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sometimes they simply need money very quickly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian security officials had not known about the "fraternal Circle" gang, Novye izvestia</seg>
<seg id="2">Interfax.ru writes about this, citing an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="3">"After reports appeared in the media about the case by the U.S. Treasury in the most recent checklists of people suspected of belonging to the Eurasian criminal Syndicate'Fraternal Circle, 'we looked at all of the databases, but such a group was not found", the interlocutor of the agency said.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his opinion, the dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.</seg>
<seg id="5">As previously mentioned, yesterday the U.S. Treasury published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal gang "Fraternal Circle ".</seg>
<seg id="6">Among them Russian singer Grigori Leps was named.</seg>
<seg id="7">He appears in the list as "grisha", posted the day before,</seg>
<seg id="8">Coincidingh with this popular Russian singer.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exact name is Grigory Lepsevridze, his performing name, and his place and date of birth.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition, in the next step, there were five more people:</seg>
<seg id="11">Two russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another with origins in the former Soviet Union, whose nationality is not specified.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the United States, they are confident that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money for the crooks on their request.</seg>
<seg id="13">Attached to this, a message and photo of the singer lists all of his data, which is accurate.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moreover, Leps, did recently buy a house in Phuket.</seg>
<seg id="15">The FBI said they intend to impose sanctions in the next step.</seg>
<seg id="16">Entering the man in the black lists of the American Treasury Department involves freezing his assets in the U.S. and a ban on business contacts with him for persons residing in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="17">Next, Assistant Maya Serikova stated that no notifications had been sent to the singer himself: "It is hard to answer the question of whether it is Grigory that everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States ."</seg>
<seg id="18">All it knows is Leps' media information.</seg>
<seg id="19">Officially, to him personally, there was no notification, even though I don't know whether there are any in such cases.</seg>
<seg id="20">"And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other, sudden and surprising," she told RIA Novosti.</seg>

<seg id="1">Do you have a black box in your car?</seg>
<seg id="2">When American designers try to find money to repair the highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box, neatly installed on the dashboard of your car.</seg>
<seg id="3">These devices, tracking every traveled mile and transmitting this information to officials, are at the center of controversial attempts to modernize the antiquated system of financing the highways of America by Washington and the states.</seg>
<seg id="4">Usually a boring arena, highway planning suddenly gave rise to intense debate and romantic alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying the government for the right to use the small design to track the number of miles you drive and even, perhaps, where you drive them - and then use this information when drawing up the tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Tea Party movement is in shock.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Liberties Union also is deeply concerned and raises a number of privacy questions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until congress can whether to continue, several states are not going to wait.</seg>
<seg id="9">They ponder how, over the next decade, to go to the system under which drivers pay for each mile driven.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motorists had taken these black boxes, some of which include satellite tracking, for testing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Is it really necessary for our country?</seg>
<seg id="12">"This is not an issue on which we might have the right choice," said Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which plans to start tracking the state authorities miles driven by every California automobile by 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">The technology to do this already exists.</seg>
<seg id="15">The need for this is aggravated by a lack of funding from the government fund for the construction of highways, funded by taxes that Americans pay on fuel.</seg>
<seg id="16">Americans are not buying as much gasoline as before.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars more miles per gallon.</seg>
<seg id="18">The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has not risen for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Politicians do not want to raise the tax by even one cent at high gasoline prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">"A tax on gasoline is simply impossible to maintain," said Lee Mannich, an expert on transportation policy at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">In his state tracking devices were recently installed in 500 cars for testing this system of payment.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It would be the best option in the long run," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Call it a user fee.</seg>
<seg id="24">Not surprisingly, this idea appeals to urban liberals, because with the help of taxes the nature of travel can be changed, for reducing road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.</seg>
<seg id="25">Authorities in California expect this system to be a strategy to achieve the ambitious targets set by the laws of this state to combat global warming.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, a Republican member of the House of Representatives Bill Shuster (PA.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said that he, too, sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
<seg id="27">Advocates of the free market group "Reason" also delighted that drivers would pay for each mile.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It is not just a tax which will go into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs of Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">People directly pay for what they receive.</seg>
<seg id="30">This movement also is supported by two former Secretaries of Transportation of the United States, which in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction of usage payment.</seg>
<seg id="31">The US Senate approved last year a pilot project at a cost of 90 million dollars, which would have involved about 10,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="32">But leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal due to fears of rural legislators representing voters who in everyday life often drive many miles to get to work or to the city.</seg>
<seg id="33">A few states and cities, nevertheless, are going on that path independently.</seg>
<seg id="34">The greatest enthusiasm is in Oregon, where participation in the largest experiment in the country has 5,000 drivers.</seg>
<seg id="35">These drivers will soon be paying a tax for miles driven instead of the tax on gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Nevada, a pilot project has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="37">In New York, it is also seen.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois employs it on a limited basis for commercial trucks.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes departments of transportation of 17 states of the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can make these changes.</seg>
<seg id="40">This concept has not received universal acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government can track their every step.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Concerns about the" Big Brother "and such things is a big problem," said Alauddin khan, head of the issues of strategy and management efficiency at the Department of Transportation for the state of Nevada.</seg>
<seg id="43">It was not what people wanted.</seg>
<seg id="44">When the tests were underway, a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: "It will be very easy to convert these devices into full tracking devices."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no need to create a huge technological infrastructure, which will inevitably be extended to the storage of records about the everyday movements of individual citizens.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is one of several states where they are soul searching low-cost technology that would allow authorities to give the state accounting of car miles driven, but no information about the place and time.</seg>
<seg id="47">If you can do it, Khan said, society will feel more calm.</seg>
<seg id="48">The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="49">Initially, this company had been attempting to collect state taxes.</seg>
<seg id="50">It sought to enter the booming market of automobile insurance, in which drivers pay based on mileage.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the device, which it began testing, attract transportation planners because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically loaded using a modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">"People will be more inclined to do it if you do not track their speed and do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">It was a big mistakes in some of these pilot programs in the state.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are much less expensive and less invasive ways to do it.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon designers are experimenting with the provision of various options.</seg>
<seg id="56">They can choose the device with or without GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or they could just abandon devices, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles driven by all residents of the state.</seg>
<seg id="58">In other places, they hope to sell the idea of convenience to the public, forcing the device to do more, not less.</seg>
<seg id="59">New York City transportation officials are seeking to develop a device which will also take payment for parking lot meters, to provide "pay as you go" insurance and gather data about speed in real time from other drivers, that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Motorists will appreciate the benefits they offer," says a document from urban design.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some designers transport systems, however, think that all this talk about paying a huge deficit is just a distraction.</seg>
<seg id="62">The Urban Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay area say that Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the trust fund the for highway construction by raising taxes on gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="63">An additional lump sum or annual tax would charge drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline that they paid their fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">"There is no need for radical surgical intervention, when all you need to do is take an aspirin," said Randy Rentshler, director of the commission on legislation and public relations.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about privacy, and many other things.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pope Francis named top cardinals in february</seg>
<seg id="2">Pope Francis in San Vozvedet named new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time of his papacy on 22 February, the Vatican announced on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cardinals are the senior clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they elect popes, so Francis will appoint its first group of people who eventually will participate in the choice of his successor.</seg>
<seg id="4">Currently there are 201 cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, after a cardinal reaches 80 years old, he can no longer take part in the election of the pope - it is the prerogative of the 120 "junior cardinals."</seg>
<seg id="6">Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony there will be a meeting all current cardinals, known as consistory.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Pope Francis decided to inform us of its decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate planning of other meetings with the participation of the cardinals from all over the world," said Lombardi.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices, "said that by February number of junior cardinals will likely fall.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that usually the Pope calls cardinals as necessary to bring the number of junior cardinals back up to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 years as he chooses.</seg>
<seg id="10">The consistory next year will have great significance because it will be the first since the election of Francis, in March of this year, according to Valero.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the moment there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It will be interesting to see whether the cardinals would appoint the new pope from other regions of the world to restore the balance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">In South America, home to 40 percent of catholics, but they are insignificant number of cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">It will also be the first selection of cardinals since the formation of Francis' Council of Cardinals — the group of eight cardinals from around the world, which is to seek ways of reforming the church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past, the popes decided everything themselves.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that "It is entirely possible" that Francis will turn to the cardinals for advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">But we have not been in this situation before — all of it is the first time for us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valero said the Pope usually put in the position of cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis is "full of surprises — we do not know who he will name."</seg>

<seg id="2">The treasury has carried out preliminary evaluation measures for the tax on capital gains, but awaits a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced the rate of state duty in the amount of 7% for homes costing more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in partnership, not as individuals.</seg>

<seg id="2">Syria has destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas stockpiles, said the international watchdog group on Thursday, while fierce clashes raged in the north of the country, close to one of the objects which is believed to store toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists said that more than 120 000 people were killed since the start of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">A statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before</seg>
<seg id="5">The deadline of 1 November, installed given by this organisation based in the Hague to Damascus, to destroy or "make inoperable" all the means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms that allow chemicals to mix, producing poison gas, or filling munitions with them.</seg>
<seg id="6">The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by the middle of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="7">The destruction of the equipment means Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="8">Yet Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.</seg>
<seg id="9">The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemical agents and weapons, including mustard gas agents and the nerve gas sarin.</seg>
<seg id="10">This statement was made during the fighting on Thursday in the town of al-Safira, which experts say is the facility for the production of chemical weapons, as well as the location of its store, reports British-based Syrian Center for Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="11">The group of activists, who watched the loss through a network of activists in Syria, said that 120 296 people had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of this number, as it was said, 61 067 are civilians, including 6365 children.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the part of the government, said the group, 29 954 people are members of the armed forces of President Bashar al-Assad, 18 678 are pro-government fighters and 187 - Lebanese Hezbollah militants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also among the dead, as stated in the statement were 2202 army defectors and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to un estimates of 25 July, 100,000 have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since then, this figure has not been updated.</seg>
<seg id="17">The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Assad's troops for several weeks fought in Safira with insurgents, many of whom are linked to al Qaeda groups.</seg>
<seg id="19">The center said Thursday there were casualties on both sides, but did not give specific figures.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fighting underscored the dangers faced by the inspectors on chemical weapons, perhaps within the tight schedule of their mission to wean syria from its toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.</seg>
<seg id="21">In a statement, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is working in close cooperation with the United Nations, said that its team was "pleased now that it had seen and verified the removal of all Syria's declared critically important means of production and mixing / filling equipment."</seg>
<seg id="22">It added that "no additional inspection activities are currently planned."</seg>
<seg id="23">Earlier this week, the inspectors said they completed the first round of testing, having visited 21 of the 23 sites Damascus declared.</seg>
<seg id="24">They have not been able to visit two places for security reasons, said the inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Thursday, the OPCW said that both places were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... the objects of the program of chemical weapons, located in them, were relocated to other declared locations, which were checked."</seg>
<seg id="26">It could not immediately be determined whether Safira was an object in one of two places, which OPCW inspectors have been unable to visit.</seg>
<seg id="27">Syria presented a plan for the complete destruction of their chemical weapons, which must be approved by next month, by the executive committee of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I salute the courage and fortitude that you all have shown in the most complex mission ever attempted this organization," said Ahmet Uzyumdzhyu, the director general of the observer group, in comments published by the OPCW.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is already the third year of civil war of the insurgents, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the government of Assad and his security forces, which consist of members of his Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.</seg>
<seg id="30">As for other events, head of the Centre Rami Abdurrahman said there was a strong blast on Wednesday at the site of Syria's air defenses in the coastal province of Latakia.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report: Obama election staff preferred the exclusion of Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the New York Times, the closest advisers of President Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden's candidacy with Hillary Clinton in the voter list of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">This discovery is the most spectacular sensation of the universally anticipated book by Mark Galperin and John Khaylemanna on campaign 2012 "Rates Udvoeny: Game Change 2012".</seg>
<seg id="4">The upcoming edition of the Times received a copy of the final book and reported on Thursday night that close aides of the president held "large-scale research in a focus group and opinion polls at the end of 2011," to assess whether the exclusion of Biden help raise Ugasayushchie hopes for Obama's re-election.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the political observer of Times jonathan martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts by senior officials, campaign staff and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley to assess what the effect on the vote would be of selecting former Secretary of State Clinton as vice-president.</seg>
<seg id="6">The possible replacement was a mystery, carefully guarded in election headquarters in Chicago and in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only six of the president's closest advisers — including Daly, the former head of Obama's campaign staff Jim Messinu and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that a replacement was considered.</seg>
<seg id="8">The book "Rates Udvoeny" argues that Daly was the initiator of attempts to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationship", but ultimately abandoned this step when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not "significantly improve the chances of Obama."</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview with Martin Daly, he confirmed that the administration really considered to replace Biden with Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I actively spoke out for the consideration of many things, and this was one of them," said Dale in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="11">You must remember that at that point the president was in awful shape, so we thought: "Oh, God, what do we do?"</seg>
<seg id="12">Although Daly described the study as a "necessary test" representative, Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that election staff invested enough in the study, to see whether this step would improve election results.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Campaign headquarters are not spending such sums of money on surveys and focus groups if they do not consider something seriously," said Martin in the program AC 360.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team studied the possibility of replacement.</seg>
<seg id="15">Martin told CNN that he asked Daly whether his then-boss knew about possible replacement.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although Daly said that he did not think the president "was aware" of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration acknowledged that "perhaps" Obama knew.</seg>
<seg id="17">Martin added that "Rates Udvoeny" does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political were reported to Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooper asked Martin, seriously whether he believes that Obama did not know about the research on excluding biden from the electoral list.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Perhaps," Martin said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian beer is in a bad mood.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to their prikidkam, consumption of beer in the country in the coming year will remain at the same level, at best.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although businessmen initially counted on growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">The current year is unfortunate for them: sales fell by 7 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">Told about all this, the head of one of the largest beer companies of the country, chairman of the Union of Russian Beer Isaac Sheps at the Third Annual Conference at the Adam Smith Institute "Commodities of Daily Demand in Russia", which just ended in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="7">It discussed the state regulation of the market.</seg>
<seg id="8">From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has shrunk by 18 per cent, as in recent years, the country has seen a significant strengthening of the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and sales of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content, - Sheps informed the listeners.</seg>
<seg id="9">In no country in the world are there such hard limit on the beer market, unpredictably introducing all new prohibitions, which ostensibly struggles with alcohol abuse.</seg>
<seg id="10">The brewer complained that many legislative bans, designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse, do not have much influence, but nevertheless all the new initiatives regularly appear.</seg>
<seg id="11">All the beer makers were hurt when hit with the ban introduced this year to sell alcohol at kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We just lost 35 thousand customers," said Isaac Sheps.</seg>
<seg id="13">For the next year there are two forecasts.</seg>
<seg id="14">The optimistic one, said Sheps: selling drinks continues at the same level.</seg>
<seg id="15">The pessimistic one - would fall even by 2-3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">To maintain their profit, businessmen are forced to quit from varieties aimed at the mass consumer, and move to "premium" class: beer will be smaller, but it will be more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="17">Meanwhile, radical consequences from falling sales with a small amount of alcohol is not in sight.</seg>
<seg id="18">"On my observations, the level of alcohol abuse remains approximately at the same level", said vrach-narkolog Alexey Sotnekov.</seg>
<seg id="19">True, the share of patients drinking surrogate alcoholic drinks increased, as well as those who consumed mixed drinks like "jaguars", whereas 10 years ago "beer alcoholism" prevailed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why would the construction of the TPU in Moscow</seg>
<seg id="2">With each passing year, city authorities promise to arrange more transportno-peresadochnykh knots (TPU).</seg>
<seg id="3">Until 2020, it is planned to enter into operation 255 tpu.</seg>
<seg id="4">What actually is the project, asks our correspondent.</seg>
<seg id="5">A couple of months ago the metro "Smolenskaya" Arbatsko-Pokrovskoy line a construction fence.</seg>
<seg id="6">The caption read, which is construction of the project's funding node.</seg>
<seg id="7">All this was very strange because near "Smolensk" no land transport stops and, therefore, cannot travel on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden ring, one must walk about 130 meters, including crossing Karmanitskiy lane.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now the "Smolensk" is almost all finished.</seg>
<seg id="10">Faded flower stall, demontirovan stand for newspapers, and the pavement in front of the entrance to bruschatkoy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Here is the entire transport hub.</seg>
<seg id="12">Transportno-peresadochnye nodes are ploskostnymi and capital - explain in the press service of the moscow department of transport.</seg>
<seg id="13">Capital TPU while are not present.</seg>
<seg id="14">But ploskostnye suggest the construction of parking lots, of shopping sites, hindering the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="15">Actually, ploskostnymi TPU even do not improve, the professional blagoustroiteli of the overhaul department of the city of moscow.</seg>
<seg id="16">The hub is not necessarily a complicated structure, explains the Director of Institute of Economy of Transport and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sometimes a roof over one's head and the arrival board, informing about the time of arrival of transport.</seg>
<seg id="18">Here, for example, the metro "Yasenevo" recently opened a full-fledged ploskostnoy interchange junction.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even without the canopies, but with perekhvatyvayushchimi car parks and the arrival board, indicating when pridet bus.</seg>
<seg id="20">But in pursuit of the number of officials at TPU record all that neither popadya.</seg>
<seg id="21">Back in 2011, City Hall planned to build at all about 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now, in plans by 2020, there are as many as 255 TPU.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some 200 of them even promise to come to pass this year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the city has the program of development of TPU, it indicated no qualitative criteria - notes Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".</seg>
<seg id="25">Report on the number of objects, but the quality of commute each of them often deteriorates.</seg>
<seg id="26">The criteria, according to the expert, there must be two: first - cutting the time of commute, second, convenience.</seg>
<seg id="27">First of all an opportunity to change the type of transport, not going out in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Moscow the same by arrangement of the TPU sometimes goes in exactly the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="29">A vivid example is metro "VDNKh".</seg>
<seg id="30">Earlier, commuter buses to the Yaroslavsky highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now they have to stop on the opposite side of the Yaroslavki Cosmonauts street.</seg>
<seg id="32">Farther from the subway, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential homes.</seg>
<seg id="33">The gift that residents do not want - a bus under their windows - and complained about in every possible instance.</seg>
<seg id="34">With capital TPU in Moscow did not immediately zadalos.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first of them started five years ago, the subway "Planernaya".</seg>
<seg id="36">The project aims to be a model.</seg>
<seg id="37">And really it was an example of how an interchange node, left to extreme investoram, turns into a banal shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="38">No, there are canopy perrony for buses, not to go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.</seg>
<seg id="39">True, khimkinskim trolleybus № 202 and № 203 in Moscow TPU seats will not give fundamentally.</seg>
<seg id="40">How strange they pushed them away from the metro.</seg>
<seg id="41">But the space under the trade more left.</seg>
<seg id="42">One of only 32 clothing store, and generally have almost everything - from pet products to the showroom.</seg>
<seg id="43">Well, in fact, who suddenly the from bus passengers needs to buy a new car for the road?</seg>
<seg id="44">We have, when building overhaul TPU, somehow always turns out shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="45">Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion, when part of the building decided to give at the market.</seg>
<seg id="46">Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planernaya" among razmechennykh on the floor of parking spaces goes boykaya trade.</seg>
<seg id="47">Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, foreign speech and security guards, angrily poglyadyvayushchie on our photographer.</seg>
<seg id="48">Interchange node finally turned into a bazaar.</seg>
<seg id="49">The fact of the matter is that before the metro "Planernaya" was a market, but it was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="50">And in the prefecture of traffickers and everything within dui allowed on perekhvatyvayushchuyu parking peresadochnogo node.</seg>
<seg id="51">Still, because of the high prices there are always empty.</seg>
<seg id="52">The same ridiculousness, that the market was demolished in order to build in its place... a new Ploskostnoy TPU.</seg>
<seg id="53">This is castling.</seg>
<seg id="54">The "Kaluzhskaya" metro distance approach from lobby metro bus was 50 meters, says Alexander Morozov.</seg>
<seg id="55">After the construction of the trade center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.</seg>
<seg id="56">To sit in the bus, it is necessary to pass through the shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="57">After 11 PM, when it is closed, one must work one's way around him, outside.</seg>
<seg id="58">However, construction on "Planernoy" and "Kaluga" soon look like the problem.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the middle of September, the commission approved gradostroitelno-zemelnaya mayor planning solutions for the first eight capital tpu.</seg>
<seg id="60">Four of them will be 25-etazhnymi, not counting two or three underground lines.</seg>
<seg id="61">The monster will grow the metro "Tushino", there will be 418,7 thousand square metres of space.</seg>
<seg id="62">Representatives of railway stations directorate of Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of the TPU from metro, already told journalists: in future mnogoetazhkakh will contain shops, hotels and apartments.</seg>
<seg id="63">At the same time, officials claim that storied parking zay ­ mut from one third to a half square.</seg>
<seg id="64">Take for example the "folk" garages.</seg>
<seg id="65">For example, the garage for 258 mashino-mest, which recently built on International street, has an area of 8015 square meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">That means, for parking the 2.6 thousand of cars have "petrovsko-razumovskoy" need on the order of 80,000 "" squares.</seg>
<seg id="67">This is less than a third of the makhiny, which gather there to build.</seg>
<seg id="68">Let one or two floors will be spent on various perrony for buses.</seg>
<seg id="69">Remains of at least 150 thousand square metres of commercial real estate.</seg>
<seg id="70">And this, in a minute, almost two pishan county.</seg>
<seg id="71">If capital TPU at stations and railroad station building, the rest of the site will explore metropolitenovtsy.</seg>
<seg id="72">They also promised that there will be a lot of objects "functional purposes", including hotels, offices and even sports halls.</seg>
<seg id="73">By the way, the Moscow Department of Property recently told journalists that they are developing a draft decree, under which investors would be able to apply for a plot at a TPU directly to the officials.</seg>
<seg id="74">Without any competitions.</seg>
<seg id="75">Because, they say, that the transport issues for the city are a priority.</seg>
<seg id="76">The ideal TPU is, for example, the "Harvard" in Boston or "Spadayna" in Toronto, asserts Alexander Morozov.</seg>
<seg id="77">There, trolleys and trams descend underground to the metro and the distance from the approach of subway cars before the tram is only 50 metres without access to the street.</seg>
<seg id="78">Around no unnecessary trade.</seg>
<seg id="79">But Moscow officials throws in the extreme.</seg>
<seg id="80">Either we will build nothing, or too otgrokhaem 25 storeys with offices and apartments.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bombardier profit declines with falling supplies and more orders for planes</seg>
<seg id="2">Bombardier Corporation, the Canadian aircraft and train maker, reported on thursday a net profit reduction of 15 percent under the influence of a reduced quantity of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division.</seg>
<seg id="3">Located in montreal, Bombardier also has not published any data for flight testing of its new C Series aircraft and provided no new information about whether it has implemented ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation by next September.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the first flight of a prototype of the aircraft, held about six months ago, it flew only three times, which raises questions about whether the testing phase is on schedule.</seg>
<seg id="5">The results have failed to meet forecasts and led to the shares falling more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered its estimate of "above average" to "below average" because of the belief that share growth is limited in the next quarter or two.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Although the reduction in the number of aircraft deliveries was largely predictable, we are, of course, disappointed by the Transport Department profit figures," said Doerksen in a review of the stock market.</seg>
<seg id="8">We believe that bombardier is geting new C Series orders as the flight test program proceeds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, if in the coming months nothing is announced about new orders, we expect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bombardier hopes that the C Series family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first prototype of the aircraft was introduced in March, and made the first flight in September after several months of delay.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the company's C Series orders so far are not very many: 177, because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to check the company's claims about fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new liner.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the moment, there are 403 orders and 15 agreements with the customers and operators.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boduan was confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first plane will be put into commercial operation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also on Thursday, executives assured analysts and the media that the program is progressing according to plan.</seg>
<seg id="16">"A test model of the aircraft has not stayed on the ground longer than expected, "said Boduan during a conference call, adding that the aircraft downtime was for planned ground tests and software updates.</seg>
<seg id="17">All manufacturers plan to test different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">We decided to spend the first flight and make a break for updates, and so we did.</seg>
<seg id="19">This will also occur during the flight test programme.</seg>
<seg id="20">The second of five test samples should take flight in the coming weeks, and all the rest will follow soon behind it, according to the company.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, analysts are skeptical of the claim that the clients will be able to start operating C Series aircraft within the 12 months after its first flight.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bombardier said that it will evaluates the commissioning and provide new information in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The slow pace of flight testing - though, apparently corresponds to Bombardier's domestic schedule, and reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015, "said Doerksen.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the third quarter, Bombardier's report of September 30 said net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged — 9 cents.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gross income fell slightly - from $4.20 to $4.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.</seg>
<seg id="28">The fourth in the world's second-largest aircraft maker announced that it had put 45 aircraft for the quarter, which is less than in the previous year — 57.</seg>
<seg id="29">The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="30">The order backlog at the Aerospace Research Department totaled $32.9 billion on September 30, less than 31 December.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In the field of aerospace, the results are consistent with our goals, but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become a troubling factor," said Boduan.</seg>
<seg id="32">Gross income among airplane makers fell by 13 percent — to $2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bombardier, the world's largest maker of trains, said that gross income in this sector grew by nearly 11 percent — to $2.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="34">The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion at september 30, slightly higher than 31 December.</seg>
<seg id="35">The transport division's income negatively impacted the problems with the execution of several large contracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">Management stated that in the fourth quarter a new development plan will be presented.</seg>
<seg id="37">Bombardier company's shares fell to 8.5 percent — up from $4,83 at auction in the middle of the day Thursday. The company also announced that Google chief financial officer Patrick Pichett has joined the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="38">Brazilian company Embraer S.A., the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, said Thursday that quarterly income would be reduced by 10 percent.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Royal Commission discovers that two YMCA employees made sex crime accusations even before the charges against Jonathan Lord.</seg>
<seg id="2">Two employees of the NSW YMCA accused Jonathan Lord, an employee of the institution's child care center in Karingbakhe, of sexual offenses against children in 2011, the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence Against Children said.</seg>
<seg id="3">But in its introductory statement, the commission was told that it "never had issues with cases of sexual abuse of children within their organization ."</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief executive officer philip Kheyra asked about one case when the YMCA worker was accused of crimes related to child pornography, and about another case when the gym instructor at Caringbah Hall was convicted of sex crimes against children who were under his supervision in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Hare said lawyer Gail Furniss, lawyer of the Okazyvayushchemu assistance commission, knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.</seg>
<seg id="6">He admitted that the YMCA, in its opening statement to the commission, also allowed inaccuracy, arguing that "there was an external review of the YMCA, that puts the YMCA directly in the firing line for the safety of the children."</seg>
<seg id="7">The commission presented evidence that suggests that the YMCA was advised that it was the second time since the end of the four possible assessments of the quality of the results of the audit made by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Hare, who joined the ymca when he was 21, admitted that he and higher leadership missed some things regarding Lord and also failed to provide a clear understanding to the staff of their obligations on reporting violations of the children security policy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sex crimes against 12 boys within two years of his employment at the YMCA.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was sentenced to prison for a mimimum of six years.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Mr. Hare has rejected the suggestion that the YMCA corporate ethics forbade employees to report Lord's violations of children's safety.</seg>
<seg id="12">Officers testified that they had observed violations, including that when lord was alone with the children, he personally seduced them, placed them in his lap, said that he likes one of them, and allowed them to play with their mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Daniel Okvell, who was under Lord's supervision and asked for him to be trained in child protection because she was worried about his behavior, certified that she found Jackie Barnett, manager of the YMCA's children's trust at the YMCA in Karingbakhe, who was Lord's boss, "very frightening and often inaccessible."</seg>
<seg id="14">The executive director said he does not accept the employees' explanation that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their senior management.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rather, he said, their friendship with Lord prevented them from thinking about the need to report it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. Hare said he presented their opinions to the New South Wales YMCA board about what lessons there are for organizations to learn from the incident, and that theissue with Lord is not related to the provision of information from employees, and the board agreed with him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Hare said that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charge was accepted by the YMCA's children's trust general manager Liam Whitley.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said it was meant to obstruct evidence of corruption, but "Pereuserdstvovali" and this decision was poorly implemented.</seg>
<seg id="19">New South Wales YMCA was not safe for children's organizations while Jonathan worked there from 2009 to 2011, said the commission's expert on problems of corruption of children, professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University.</seg>
<seg id="20">He said that there were "serious problems" during the recruitment, selection, instruction, training, and control ofpersonnel.</seg>
<seg id="21">The hearing postponed has been until 20 December.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ben Grinman: the tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: the New Yorker</seg>
<seg id="2">You can safely argue that New York is a birthplace of standup comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, musical artist and entertainer Frank Fay, who worked at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the public, in a manner of speaking.</seg>
<seg id="3">An innovation that was eventually picked up by others, more recently the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
<seg id="4">Created and coordinated by Caroline Kersh, founder of Caroline's Standup Club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, counting more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theatres.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Most of these performers started at Caroline's, and then achieved more success, until they achieved a level when they were already too famous to perform at the club," said Kersh.</seg>
<seg id="6">We created the festival as a way to continue to work with them.</seg>
<seg id="7">This year, the event includes performances by Wendy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as stand-up comedy for "heroes" — an annual musical comedy charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden where, among others, will be Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.</seg>
<seg id="8">The extension of the festival has expanded the world of comedy.</seg>
<seg id="9">A few comedians, participating in the festival this year, gained popularity unconventionally, for example, thanks to shows on small television channels like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nick Kroll gained notoriety thanks to roles in a comedy series on the little known cable tv ("intentionally" Skabreznaya league by FX on the topic of fantasy football) and now leads his own sketch show on Comedy Central.</seg>
<seg id="11">Jenny Slate has joined the cast of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though most of all she is known for a series of viral videos "marcel" Rakushka boots. "</seg>
<seg id="12">And Krall and Slate, like other young comedians with original style (surrealistic pessimistic Anthony Dzheselnik, who is sly and focuses on racial themes Mau Bell), is a result of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the highlights of the festival is that David will interview hall of fame-honoree linebacker Larry David.</seg>
<seg id="14">Steinberg began as a stanup comedian, but then became a successful director on television and in the movies, as well as the unofficial historian of comedy.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2005 to 2007 he was the leading show on TV Land called Sitdown Comedy with David Steinberg.</seg>
<seg id="16">The interview will be held at the Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="17">"This city is surely the central element of Larry's work," Steinberg said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks on a street between two houses, and thinks: "What if I were completely broke? Perhaps I would live here."</seg>
