<seg id="1">Anger over the verdict to the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali</seg>
<seg id="2">The remaining survivors and relatives of 202 died as a result of the bombing in Bali in 2002, reacted angrily to the verdict of the last of the conspirators, who appeared before the court and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in south-east Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building the explosive devices used in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="4">He could be freed within 15 years if she gets parole.</seg>
<seg id="5">45Th and the defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of attacks on two night club in the popular tourist area of Kuta, during which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was also found guilty on a number of other charges related to terrorism, including in a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prosecutors have demanded life imprisonment, although they could insist that the man, nicknamed "the master podryvnikom" for his reputation for making explosives, should be sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="8">This decision has painful memories of the mother from Perth June kortin, which lost its 39-letnikh docherey-bliznetsov Jane and Jenny in the terrorist attack, and his osushchestvlennom patekom soobshchnikami almost ten years ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">Barely concealing his own tears, she said that Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I really believe that he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.</seg>
<seg id="11">He must appear before rasstrelnoy team, "said Ms. kortin AAP.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer be grandchildren and I don't see my daughters."</seg>
<seg id="13">"The Sari Club" was destroyed when it was set in motion a massive explosive device, implicit in a van parked outside, just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.</seg>
<seg id="14">Peter Hughes was in the bar "Paddy", where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack, with a ton of explosives, only 20 seconds earlier.</seg>
<seg id="15">After that attack, he fell into a coma and a month "died" three times, being connected to a life-support system.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah, responsible for a bloodbath — Amrozi, mukhlasa and imam samudry who were executed four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty all the more.</seg>
<seg id="18">To save his life, well, there is no reason to save his life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Get 20 years after killed 202 people and wounded hundreds is not so much.</seg>
<seg id="20">Patek is the last of the terrorist attack in Bali, predstavshim before a court of law.</seg>
<seg id="21">He was hiding for almost a decade, but in the end was arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al Qaeda boss Osama bin Laden less than four months later.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the trial, an FBI agent testified that the intelligence testified: Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to restore the ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="23">"He didn't give up," said Ms. kortin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently he regretted nothing about how much grief he caused others.</seg>
<seg id="25">The judge in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This year there will be a lot of tears," said Ms. kortin.</seg>

<seg id="1">The manufacturers of jet aircraft feud over seat width, when large orders at stake</seg>
<seg id="2">Between the leading manufacturers of aircraft inflamed violent dispute about the width of the tourist class seats on long flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai air show this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dispute focuses on the dynamic of the width of the seats available to passengers on long-haul flights in economy class, whose interests are not always the centre of attention of the airlines, with the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in statements about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by Boeing Co and Airbus SAS.</seg>
<seg id="4">Airbus this week called for the introduction of industry standard, which would have included the width of the seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class salons, but its main American rival, Boeing says it must solve the airline.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales of increasingly large versions of their dvukhmotornykh long-haul aircraft and 17 at the event – 21 November expected potentially record orders.</seg>
<seg id="6">The layout of the rear part of the plane — especially the sitting whether 9 or 10 people in a row — occupies a central place in statements about the economic performance of new projects "mini-aerobusov."</seg>
<seg id="7">Boeing argues that its new 777X will be reduced to 406 people on the basis of seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width, placed on the 10 in each row.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airbus says that its competing version of the A350 will be transported in ekonom-klasse 350 people on seats 18 inches wide, located on nine in a row.</seg>
<seg id="9">Aircraft manufacturing giants often exchanged blows on technical issues with the help of professional advertising in the press.</seg>
<seg id="10">And now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public before aviashou in Dubai, where the 777X, is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">She recently demonstrated what may be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing financiers slide, representing three people in the restaurant, prizhatykh to each other, titled "you would agree to that?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boeing offers dalnemagistralnye flights on seats narrower than the regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Likhi.</seg>
<seg id="13">With the change of diet of people gaining weight, but samoletnye seats have not changed dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="14">Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 asked modern standards and long-distance travel abroad century average weight of American men aged 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent, according to the Department of Health of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">Obkhvat waist of the average American male of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistics of the U.S. Public Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus says that its rival is committed to the concept of the seats of the 1950s, when the average waist obkhvat those recently called "reactive", the audience was already.</seg>
<seg id="17">Airbus says that ordered a study indicating that an extra inch in seat width improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing disputed Airbus figures on the size of seats and said that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines to find balance between tariffs and amenities.</seg>
<seg id="19">She said studies show that the convenience of salon depends not only on the width of the seats.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It really comes down to providing airlines choice and the opportunity to do what they believe they need to do to succeed," said Specialist Boeing on saloon Kent kreyver.</seg>
<seg id="21">They do not want us to be solved for them that will bring them profits.</seg>
<seg id="22">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="23">For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind this dispute is the race for orders for planes, at least in the $700 billion on katalozhnym prices in the coming decades — enough to change the balance of the American and European exports.</seg>
<seg id="25">As first reported by Reuters in July the agency, the location of the seats is what fuels rivalry in the battle between the latest reactive aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both Airbus and Boeing, as well as announcing 20-protsentnom improving profitability at one place in their latest long-haul dvukhmotornykh models compared with the market leader in this segment, 365-mestnym Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="27">The claimed characteristics of Boeing are based in part on comparing 10-mestnykh rows 777X with original 9-mestnoy layout of constructive solutions 777.</seg>
<seg id="28">The win in the specific cost decreases when compared with 10-mestnoy layout used currently.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The reason why Boeing makes it, is to squeeze more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared with our development," said Kevin Keniston, Airbus head of passenger comfort in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand, analysts say the parlors with full 10-mestnymi rows for existing 777-kh indicate that many passengers prefer dense be made on seating arrangements, which can go hand in hand with lower fares.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Seat width of 18 inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view offer Airbus due to the threat from 777-y model," said Specialist Interior Salon Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl network.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing does not provide chairs, but offer the catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can select.</seg>
<seg id="33">Exploring the world of the Jets even with blocking a roulette to check the competing plans.</seg>
<seg id="34">Praising the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very dense layout salon for budget airlines and regional flights.</seg>

<seg id="3">"We want to return peace; we want stability," said Vanessa de-susa, executive director of the investment company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fearing for the future of their country, she traded a business suit on a T-shirt decorated the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined in the capital on Thursday to a crowd in Independence Square.</seg>
<seg id="5">Within two weeks there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo — it is one of the most violent clashes since the signing of the ceasefire, more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Renamo was once known rebel movement, which was driven by the first white government of Rhodesia, and then the government of the South Africa of the apartheid era in an effort to destabilize the government of an independent country.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the armistice of 1992 it became the opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again skatitsya for full conflict, but recent events have made me nervous foreign investors and local residents.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, since the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion, as investment in the next few years, from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling party, Frelimo, a leading political force since 1975, and the party Renamo accuse each other in this tension.</seg>
<seg id="11">Party Renamo argues that the government has become the latest challenger collisions, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, traditional an Renamo, 17 October.</seg>
<seg id="12">The attack on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked a base Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso dkhlakamu — the leader of the group, told the newspaper the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, representative Renamo.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government blames Renamo in triggering clashes, accusing the party in an attack on soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza tried to allay fears of instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">Guebuza told AFP, the French information agency on Wednesday that Mr. dkhlakama felt "loser" zakhotevshim use "all that is left of his forces to try to prove that he can impose the government own decisions."</seg>
<seg id="16">As Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But worries have grown after reports that said Mazanga refusal Renamo from the peace agreement of 1992.</seg>
<seg id="18">He told the Financial Times that meant Frelimo party to the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Our goal is to return to talks, but very seriously," said Mazanga.</seg>
<seg id="20">Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which led to a series of clashes this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is two influential person (and) Guebuza dkhlakama struggling against," said Joseph khanlon lecturer, Open University and an expert on Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="22">None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to go on the necessary concessions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Party Renamo, which tries to get electoral reform, has already announced that it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.</seg>
<seg id="24">Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators have interpreted it as an attempt to pressure oslabevshego movement to achieve concessions and financial bonuses from the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">The share of votes for Renamo decreases since 1992, while a new party - the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by former member of Renamo is expected to improve their performance in these elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza, who is to step down next year, when ends his second term, wants to destroy democracy in the country.</seg>
<seg id="28">"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he did not want to transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the post of president," said Mazanga.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear what possibilities has Renamo, but she has already had devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the motorway leading from the north to the south.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala province, which is just a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes beyru — port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June, Rio has suspended use of the railways for about a week after Renamo threatened an attack on the railroad.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mazanga was uklonchiv when he asked a question about whether repeat Renamo this threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">The party "Renamo wanted to warn the international community about what matters in Mozambique are not very good," said Mazanga.</seg>
<seg id="34">Instability has added to discontent with the government, but many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recently more frequent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop independent media companies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country are the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Omar sultuan, participated in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Nobody cares neither Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want a renewal of the world, they want to free access to the roads," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former editor of The News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used the "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" when trying to confirm false information about the novel, Charles Clarke, who was at that time the post of minister of internal affairs.</seg>

<seg id="8">Obviously, he knows about the second, about watching, he simply must.</seg>

<seg id="10">Whether he knew about hack phones?</seg>
<seg id="11">He says no, we say: "Oh, yes!"</seg>
<seg id="12">Rumors about the novel Clark first attracted the attention of the edition of the News of the world when the source, sexually interested in Ms. polbi, said: "Do not waste time, it with Charles."</seg>
<seg id="13">Cassette with voice messages obtained from her phone at least three times, was removed from the house mulkeyra in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="14">Investigators also found on the computer records of a private detective, in which Miss polbi and her sister referred as "projects".</seg>
<seg id="15">During the period when it was under observation, grandmother and grandfather of Ms. polbi received anonymous calls with requests to provide information about her, said Mr Edis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists shed light on how the tail of dog related to her mood.</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier research has shown that happy dogs vilyayut tail in the right side (from the point of view of a dog), while dogs alarmed pomakhivayut tail mainly in the left side.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now, scientists say that other members of the family dog may notice these subtle differences in vilyanii tail and react to them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, neyrobiolog from trentskogo University, says: "It is well known that people have left and right side of the brain differently are involved in shaping the stimulators, which are positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Here we have tried to look at this and many other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that just like humans, dogs have the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.</seg>
<seg id="7">To learn more about how dogs react to various povilivaniya tails of other dogs, the researchers watched the animals when they watched films about other dogs.</seg>
<seg id="8">They measured the frequency of heartbeat animals and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
<seg id="9">Perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes heading in one direction, and sometimes — in another</seg>
<seg id="10">Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed videos of dogs with dogs — either naturalisticheskie version or silhouette, to get rid of any of the other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct more tail left or right."</seg>
<seg id="11">When the animals have seen that nothing in the rest of the tail expressing the dog moved to the right (from the point of view of vilyayushchey tail dogs), they were totally relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when they noticed that the tail was left mainly (again from the point of view of vilyayushchey tail dogs), their heartbeat uchashchalos and they looked alarmed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Professor Vallortigara said that he does not think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other using these movements.</seg>
<seg id="14">In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience, about what movements they should worry about, and what is not.</seg>
<seg id="15">He says: "If there are several meetings with other dogs and often vilyanie their tail to one side is associated with more friendly behavior, while the right side is less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts on the basis of that experience."</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers say that these results may give owners, vet and dressirovshchikam deeper understanding of emotions of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="17">An expert in the field of behavior of dogs, John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher in the School of Veterinary bristolskogo University, said it was not the first study to test whether a value for dogs left and right side.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn the head to the left, if they look at an aggressive dog, and right, if they look at dovolnuyu dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">And in other scientific work at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "dogs often approached sobake-robotu when its tail vilyanie napravlyalos left, not right, rather than become alarmed — the opposite of behavior towards the Italian study."</seg>
<seg id="20">He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies are not entirely susceptible animals in films or sobak-robotov as dogs.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.</seg>
<seg id="22">"While on various mammals there is enough evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes, many details are yet to be specified, and dogs are no exception," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, given the ease with which it can be registered their behavior, perhaps, soon we will understand why their tails sometimes heading in one direction, and sometimes — in another.</seg>

<seg id="8">Complete refusal of animal products harmful.</seg>
<seg id="9">In animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for the plant.</seg>

<seg id="14">Doctors are confident that residents of Siberia need to pay special attention to the ratsionu in winter.</seg>
<seg id="15">Especially in this season of vegetarianism is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="16">In terms of our realities imposed higher requirements for food.</seg>
<seg id="17">To keep warm, you need the extra calories.</seg>
<seg id="18">"If people limit themselves to animal products, respectively, this calorie he nedobiraet", says expert.</seg>
<seg id="19">With this agree vrach-dietolog Olga Późniak coat of arms.</seg>
<seg id="20">She adds that imported fruits and vegetables is not a solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities were observed in most cities around the world since the second half of the 20th century.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a rule, it was either about their re-invent and expanding highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.</seg>
<seg id="4">Widely known example of Singapore where introduced strict quota increase in the number of private vehicles, and the right of their purchase is bought at auctions.</seg>
<seg id="5">His price may exceed two to three times the price of the car.</seg>
<seg id="6">European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry into the center of the city.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introducing the so-called Green Zone, where entry is allowed only cars with certain ekoklassom using a fuel of high quality (including biofuels or electric cars).</seg>
<seg id="8">Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 "five-year plan of clean air" worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).</seg>
<seg id="9">As he told Kommersant the director for control vehicle pollution of Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau whether Kunsheng, the main objective of the plan is the reduction of major air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, an increase in the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (5.2 million now), as well as an increase of no more than 5% of fuel per one vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the agency, now motor vehicles in Beijing responsible for 22.5% of the total air pollution.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among the key measures of the program is the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the imposition of additional taxes for car owners.</seg>
<seg id="12">Among other things, the City measures "green five-year plan" include accelerated compared with the rest of the country transition to fuel European standards, the introduction of the local system ekostandartov and labelling of cars and fuel restrictions on entry of cars in the central part of the city, a ban on the use of outdated vehicles (besides creating a financial incentive programs to replace old vehicles to hybrid or electric cars), the development of electric vehicle (including public and official), the development of public transport (including high-speed).</seg>

<seg id="14">According to the state programme "environmental protection for the years 2012-2020", the number of towns with high and very high air pollution must be reduced to 128 (in 2012, there were 138).</seg>

<seg id="18">The director of the Institute of Economy of transport and the transport policy of the HSE, Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for car travel is obviously unpopular, they can be taken only by assuming their complete versatility.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the case of Moscow is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where there are two cluster weakly sensitive to any regulatory impacts - service and personal cars, as well as vehicles "preferred" users, the total number of which is not less than 200 thousand.

<seg id="21">The key findings of researchers: city centre roads with two times less required, but most motorists living in the center, do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods of time on car parks or simply on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, it is proposed to build't parking and rental store, not to expand, and reduce road a part (in order to the streets became more friendly for pedestrians), as well as limit the use and placing personal transport within the conservation area of historic centre (common ground around 3212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).</seg>

<seg id="8">This man receives $250,000 to continue his remarkable work.</seg>
<seg id="9">For 21 years, Georges bvelle saw his father came back to life and again sink into unconsciousness, wandering across hospitals, which were not properly equipped to help him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzhamef bvelle was injured in a car crash in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.</seg>
<seg id="11">At first he had only a broken hand but the contagion spread to the brain and caused gematomu, which resembled a about himself to the end of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">"In Cameroon had no neurosurgeons," said Georges bvelle.</seg>
<seg id="13">If we had the money, we would have flown him from Cameroon.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, bvelle years accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals receiving any treatment that they could get.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It is not easy," said bvelle.</seg>
<seg id="16">— You can withdraw from the house at 5 a.m. to run back to the hospital to be first, but you are not the first.</seg>
<seg id="17">Patients very much.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some may die because they have to wait.</seg>
<seg id="19">The situation is not much changed since the father bvelle died in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon, only one doctor for 5,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="21">By comparison, the ratio in the United States — one doctor at 413 people.</seg>
<seg id="22">And even if kameruntsy could have gone to a doctor, many of them it could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="23">Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of health expenditures in it are private.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Their only problem is poverty," said bvelle.</seg>
<seg id="25">— And because of the poverty they cannot enjoy their lives. "</seg>
<seg id="26">Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, bvelle became determined to do something with this.</seg>
<seg id="27">Last year, Dr Georges bvelle and his team of volunteers spent 700 free operations.</seg>
<seg id="28">He became a doctor and has vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.</seg>
<seg id="29">He also founded the non-profit organization ascovime, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since 2008, he and his band of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost every Friday, he and another 30 people nabivayutsya in vans, which chain to roofs medical supplies and travel over rough terrain to visit villages need help.</seg>
<seg id="32">Not always brings them luck.</seg>
<seg id="33">More than once they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud.</seg>
<seg id="34">But when they arrive, they are welcomed as the true heroes: this holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms which can only suggest local residents.</seg>
<seg id="35">Free medical care in these villages really is a cause for celebration, and bvelle with his broad smile and infinite energy is more than happy to join in the fun.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next morning the team starts to take hundreds of patients.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We have 500 people on each trip," said bvelle.</seg>
<seg id="38">They come from the whole vicinity within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.</seg>
<seg id="39">Each of these clinics weekend provides a variety of medical services.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people get treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, disease, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others may receive donated crutches points or free birth certificates - documents needed for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the evening, the brigade has a simple operation under a local anesthesia.</seg>
<seg id="43">Surgery is usually held in the building of the school, municipality or in the house; after the procedure, patients come and go in posleoperatsionnuyu area to make space for the next person.</seg>
<seg id="44">Using a generator to provide lighting operating and sanitization equipment bvelle and its volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="45">This determination neposilnyy pace, but teams usually help to keep rural musicians.</seg>
<seg id="46">"They all night beat the drums, so we were awake and continued to work," said bvelle.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Sunday, the brigade members sent back to town, tired, but proud of his work.</seg>
<seg id="48">This group, consisting of kamerunskikh foreign doctors and medical students, has 700 free operations last year, and they know that their aid could be of great value for those they help.</seg>
<seg id="49">One man explained that they obtained free surgery for the hernia treatment will allow him to work again.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This will change the future for me and my family," the man said.</seg>
<seg id="51">In addition to these clinical methods in the weekend and work in a hospital surgeon bvelle also works nights in a private medical clinics around the Yaoundé.</seg>

<seg id="53">"I don't even know when he sleeps," said Cathy O'melli, a second year medical student drekselskogo University in Philadelphia, the volunteer group in bvelle.</seg>
<seg id="54">He has always either in the hospital or trying to earn money for the organization to continue with these campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="55">For future doctors and nurses, such as about'melli coming from the United States and Europe to join bvelle in implementing its objectives, it is an opportunity to practice, which they would never have got at home.</seg>
<seg id="56">"We have got to assistirovat on operations, where we helped remove the stains of blood or keep the tools for doctors bvelle", — said about'melli.</seg>
<seg id="57">Being studentom-vtorokursnikom, you would never get this kind of opportunity in America.</seg>
<seg id="58">Studenty-volontery usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with pozhertvovannymi medicines.</seg>
<seg id="59">But on arrival in Yaounde them meals, transport and education pays bvelle.</seg>
<seg id="60">"He is a hero, without a doubt," said about'melli.</seg>
<seg id="61">He gives his life to this organisation, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon indefinitely.</seg>
<seg id="62">For bvelle almost constant work load is not an ordeal.</seg>
<seg id="63">Helping others to live a happy life, to fulfil this promise to his father — that is what brings him great joy.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I am so happy when I do this job," said bvelle.</seg>
<seg id="65">"And I think about my father.</seg>
<seg id="66">I hope he sees that I do.</seg>

<seg id="1">Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy</seg>
<seg id="2">Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to the fragile driver of economic growth in Russia, consumption.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is primarily a crisis of arrears on unsecured consumer loans and mass layoffs of workers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Our main concern now is not that growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lately, he is almost entirely due to consumption, which does not ease turnovers ", said Goldman Sachs chief economist for Russia, representing Clemens column yesterday quarterly report anywhere on the Russian economy.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.</seg>
<seg id="7">With inflation at 6 percent, he will be able to meet future consumer demand roughly at the current level, expect at Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, however, most likely, they will improve the expenditure on staff.</seg>
<seg id="9">Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages are rising by 10 per cent, while GDP is only 2%, explained Mr. column.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company experienced a decline in profitability.</seg>
<seg id="11">If it does not rise, it can lead to lay-offs and rise in unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not to raise the salaries of Russian businesses cannot, said Barclays Capital chief economist for Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unemployment near historical lows, competition for workers is high.</seg>
<seg id="14">To lure away from employees or keep the current employers to raise wages.</seg>
<seg id="15">Consumption in Russia Podder ­ zhivaetsya and very rapid growth potrebkreditovaniya.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Mr. Fields, because of the extremely high rates on consumer loans multiplikativnogo effect on the economy of the country, this kind of lending does not.</seg>
<seg id="17">The benefit to the economy from growing potrebkreditovaniya we saw no, the money does not go to the economy, and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments, said economist.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the problem in another - at Goldman Sachs expect growth of delay on unsecured credit.</seg>
<seg id="19">They are mostly not rich who have nothing to offer as security.</seg>
<seg id="20">Interest rates on such loans are high.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a result, they often do not return, "said Mr. column.</seg>
<seg id="22">However the second threat to economic growth in Russia - a possible crisis of arrears on unsecured credit.</seg>
<seg id="23">The director of the HSE Institute banking Vasily solodkov now sees signs of growing banking crisis.</seg>
<seg id="24">'Petit credit organizations without access to cheap resources, which have gosbankov, were forced to raise funds for the population with high interest.</seg>
<seg id="25">In response, gosbanki went on the war-path and began to lower lending rates, says economist.</seg>
<seg id="26">'Petit credit organizations cannot give loans under the same interest, otherwise they will have negative interest margin.</seg>
<seg id="27">If not abandon gosbanki dumping, Russia is in a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily solodkov.</seg>
<seg id="28">Revocation of the licences of several banks in recent weeks, the economist believes it a harbinger of collapse.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Themselves gosbanki't cope with such a situation: a system of deposit insurance was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," warns head of the Institute.</seg>
<seg id="30">But consumption growth will slow and without the crisis of non-payments, believe in the prestigious - because of the refusal of indexing salaries for civil servants and the military, which in the current version of the draft budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">Partially hit consumption will be softened by the freeze tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, reduced inflation).</seg>
<seg id="32">But only partly: if investments do not rise (and the prerequisites for this are not yet - see the certificate), consumption growth still slows, confident of Goldman Sachs.</seg>
<seg id="33">Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital until he sees the prerequisites for implementation of the pessimistic scenarios.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The main risk is still falling oil prices, he says.</seg>
<seg id="35">In his estimation, the Russian economy will shrink when the cost of oil below $90 per barrel.</seg>
<seg id="36">At Goldman Sachs also noted that while the central bank cannot cut interest rates in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="37">There is a paradoxical picture: inflation fell, and banks have been raising rates.</seg>
<seg id="38">This may mean that they did not believe the central bank, obyavivshemu transition to targetirovaniyu inflation ", said Clemens column.</seg>
<seg id="39">The policy of the central bank on market rates, affects not only affects the interbank lending rates.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Hopes for central bank it all collapse," praised the Clemens box.</seg>
<seg id="41">The money received by the central bank auctions, banks are not lending to the economy, and to manage its liquidity</seg>
<seg id="42">As soon as the reduced rate, just changing the exchange rate, it means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the rouble.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Sooner or later, the central bank will understand that this strategy is not working," said Mr. column and reminded that let the rouble float in "" state plans by the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="44">But will either have to do this before, or pick up a key central bank rate (5.5%), he says.</seg>
<seg id="45">In his estimation, the ruble is artificially overvalued by 10%.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ruble only one road is weakening, - the expert concludes.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if the central bank zaronit in finansistakh even the shadow of a doubt that the currency is not part of the policy to weaken the currency, it can bring down the ruble is much stronger.</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA: "air passengers can now use the gadgets on planes (but not to call from your mobile phone)"</seg>
<seg id="2">Aviapassazhiry will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talking on mobile phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines, published on Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
<seg id="3">But passengers should not expect change to occur immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">FAA to airlines will have to show how their planes meet the new guidelines and that they update their training manuals for members of the flight crew and the rules on the installation of devices to conform to the new guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="6">FAA said it has already received from some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Delta and JetBlue were among airlines, which have already submitted plans.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Depending on the condition of the plan we could approve the increased use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA stated.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers are currently required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.</seg>
<seg id="10">They should not restart them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain will not give "welcome."</seg>
<seg id="11">Passengers should turn off their devices once again when the plane is going down for planting, and not to include them, while the plane is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines, whose planes properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and ruleniya, FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most new airliners and other planes modified so that passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, is expected to meet these criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura gleyding, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the change.</seg>
<seg id="15">"After the new policy will be implemented safely (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this, it will be the win-win option," said gleyding.</seg>
<seg id="16">We frankly are tired of feeling "dezhurnymi on school" when it comes to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the Internet connection for web browsing, exchange of electronic letters, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thus, still no "Words With Friends" — intellectual gaming, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011, when there was a notable case: the actor was filmed with the airline American Airlines flight for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the aircraft was at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">But heavier devices, such as laptops, still need to be laid in the luggage storage office because they can injure someone if they were flying around the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="21">Calls from the mobile phone in flight are still banned.</seg>
<seg id="22">Regulatory powers on telephone calls to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="23">FAA may remove a ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
<seg id="24">Last month Mark rozenker from the National Council for Transport Safety, the national transport safety expert for CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered at risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Cell phones — it really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we know thanks to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers is when the plane is in the air," said rozenker.</seg>
<seg id="26">An FAA advisory committee created to study this issue, recommended last month that the government allowed the more widespread use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">In recent years, the growing pressure on the FAA with the aim of easing restrictions on their use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics, such as Democrats Senator from Missouri Claire makkaskil, argue that there is no legitimate reason for the prohibitions related to security.</seg>
<seg id="29">The restrictions also becomes more difficult to secure, as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions off its devices.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA to restrict passenger use of electronic devices in 1966, in response to reports of pomekhakh for navigation and communications equipment, when passengers began to wear a fm-radiopriemniki — high-tech gadgets of the time.</seg>
<seg id="32">New airplanes are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they also developed and approved FAA as resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
<seg id="33">The airline offered passengers use WiFi at cruising altitude already for several years.</seg>
<seg id="34">The aircraft, a modified for wi-fi-sistem also more resistant to interference.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of ships adapted for wider use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today's electronic devices typically emit radio much lower power than previous generation devices.</seg>
<seg id="37">The device for reading electronic books, for example, emit only minimal signals at perelistyvanii pages.</seg>
<seg id="38">But signals are becoming more powerful when the device download or send data.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among those who pushed for easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices of passengers, was the company Amazon.com.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2011 the company representatives have downloaded a airliner their devices for reading electronic books for Kindle and flew him to check for problems, but never found them.</seg>
<seg id="41">FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices presents any risk.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd from the National Association of passengers said he believes distractions from the real device, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other members of the committee said that there are only individual messages pilots, confirming that the devices might be creating interference for aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAA require pilots allowed passengers to turn off devices during landings on the appliances in limited visibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">A group of representatives from the tourism industry welcomed the changes, calling them are a step towards passengers who now use a variety of technological devices.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not inconsistent with safety and protection," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

<seg id="1">The new vaccine antinikotinovaya may inhibit the process of smoking pleasure</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have developed antinikotinovuyu vaccine, which could deprive the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
<seg id="4">Further tests are needed before trials on humans, in that it will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from ueyll Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the first results are encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We very much hope that this strategy of using vaccines can finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit, isprobovav all methods available in the market today, but find their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it by using these modern means," said Professor Cornell.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of antibodies antinikotinovykh.</seg>
<seg id="7">Selectively virus infects liver cells, which then began to produce a steady stream of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">Antibodies trace any nicotine molecules in the blood, neytralizuya them before they reach the brain, preventing getting a smoker nikotinovogo strike.</seg>
<seg id="9">In tests vaktsinirovannye mouse, which later gave the nicotine, continued their normal activities.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the mouse, which did not give the vaccine, "" relax our effort relying solely, and it is a sign that the nicotine reached out to them - the brain, researchers say.</seg>
<seg id="11">These experiments described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous tobacco vaccine failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, injections needed to do so often that they were expensive and nepraktichnymi.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because she makes liver cells in the factories of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it would give the children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nikotinovuyu dependence.</seg>
<seg id="16">But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them get rid of this habit," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed.</seg>

<seg id="17">Passengers often complain of fees for baggage and other fees, but airline adore them.</seg>
<seg id="18">They argue that the baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service should pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many on Wall Street believe the addition of baggage fees sign that airlines collect enough money to cover the costs of air travel after several years of losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">But most of them are not related to the fees for hand luggage.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit Airlines Inc. has introduced the first hand baggage fee for three years ago and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed her example.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only other airline with this collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airlines consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the extra fees.</seg>
<seg id="23">In his assessment of the report from December 2011, the charge for hand luggage Spirit brings in $50 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines senior manager, recently flew on flight spirit, and he was wondering what he would find at the gate, where the passengers will face an unusual collection of spirit for hand luggage.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The process of planting was the smooth of those that I have seen in my career in the airlines," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plane was full, he said, "and the landing passed quickly."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier also follows the spirit in respect of fees at $2 for coffee, tea, gazirovku or juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frontier said that passengers who get gazirovku or juice, can leave a whole jar and that doliv coffee will be provided free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="30">It will still be handing out free water.</seg>
<seg id="31">US Airways short time trying to charge for drinks in 2008, but abandoned this in seven months, after passengers began to complain, and no other major airline not followed her example.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the initiative of the frontier vzimaniyu fee for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, it is the latest measure to attract customers to its Web site.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines pay onlayn-prodavtsam tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
<seg id="34">This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them and not to contact the travel onlayn-agentstvo.</seg>
<seg id="35">But Frontier all went further in this area.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September, she started to give two times less often miles flying passenger customers who bought tickets through online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday she cut premialnoe number of miles up to 25 percent of the miles of travel.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, the trip to 1,000 miles from the frontier, bought from online travel agency, would get 250 miles.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the website of the frontier.</seg>
<seg id="40">The frontier is the base of loyal customers in her hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming loss.</seg>
<seg id="41">Revenue fell 9 percent, and flight opportunities fell by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results announced Wednesday the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
<seg id="42">Republic is trying to rectify finance frontier in the sale of the airline.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents can choose interseksualnykh children "uncertain" Paul</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany became the first European country, which acknowledged the third floor in children born with external sex organs of intermediate type.</seg>
<seg id="3">The newborn will no longer be necessary to attribute a male or female gender.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children, allowing parents to set the floor as "indefinite" or "unidentified" in their birth certificates.</seg>
<seg id="5">The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents that can take quick decisions about surgery for assigned gender newborn, and counter discrimination interseksualnykh people.</seg>
<seg id="6">One interseksualnyy people, according to the BBC, he said many years later: "I am not a man and not a woman."</seg>
<seg id="7">I stay by doctors patchwork of product with bruises and scars.</seg>
<seg id="8">Roughly one in two thousand children, background, every year is neither boy nor girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">They have one of the intersex, approximately 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development "— the collective term for people with atipichnymi chromosomes, gonadami (yaichnikami or semennikami) or unusually razvivshimisya external sex organs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wallis Simpson may have been interseksualom.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gender identification is still not understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign to it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if it happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="12">New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law "sounds like a good idea."</seg>
<seg id="13">Interseksualnye children creates an ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention, but the majority of children is not present them," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">You can assign to the floor without surgery and then see how personality develops.</seg>
<seg id="16">The science of how the child will develop a gender identity, not too accurate.</seg>
<seg id="17">No one can answer questions about why this is happening.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is a mystery about why people are being homosexual.</seg>
<seg id="19">The report sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes interseksualnykh people as distinct from transgender or transgender because their condition relates to't genderu, but to their biological structure which does not correspond to solely neither male nor female sex, and typical of both at once or not typical for any one of them.</seg>
<seg id="20">These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual symptoms such as muscle mass, hair distribution cover, chest and physique; primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and gormonakh.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report also gives a general idea about the discrimination faced by interseksualnye and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crime on the ground of prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="22">The boys from gender variations now have a special camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Australia and Nepal has already allow adults to male, female or "third gender" in its official documents.</seg>
<seg id="24">In June, a 52-year-old resident of Australia norri mey-uelbi became the first person in the world, acknowledged "bespolym" otstoyav in court the right to maintain "undetermined" sexual status for life.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the third German passports will be used in addition to Mark M, F or X, i.e. interseksualnyy.</seg>
<seg id="26">In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on the TV channel France 24.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this a deeply Catholic country, signed a petition to remove the "gender theory" from school textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="28">American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is involved in a new state, where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity — no, we still perevorachivaem two pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">One mother of a newborn baby from the Maryland site zone also announced that it would have to set the floor for children at birth.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is difficult enough to raise a child, and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child," she said Web site for parents.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and confidence.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, children born with male and female reproductive organs, named germafroditami — named handsome Greek god who had signs of both sexes.</seg>
<seg id="33">And yet just ten years ago the medical community vosprinimalo gender as a sheet on which we can all erase and then draw again.</seg>
<seg id="34">But now many are questioning the ethical justification for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes makes the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will be assigned him to the floor, when will grow.</seg>
<seg id="35">"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called" "urgent psychiatric case," Drescher said.</seg>
<seg id="36">When these children were born, you rang't psychiatrist — you rang the surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The dominant theory about how to treat children with genitaliyami intermediate type, was proposed by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender easily amenable to change.</seg>
<seg id="38">He introduced into circulation, the term "gender identity" and argued that the signals of the environment, including the social — that, as parents, the parents of the child — interact with genes and hormones child, determining whether a person is considered to be a male or female.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in one case of 1966, known as "John / Joan", his theories were called into question.</seg>
<seg id="40">He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during the circumcision, negligent child also entirely castrating, removing his testicles, and raise him as a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Mani presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but this was not the case," said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="42">When he was about 15 years old, he became a little boy again and married to a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">But in 38 years, he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">Drescher said that today, some doctors are still "apply this model."</seg>
<seg id="45">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived the operation for a sex change, declared himself "dissatisfied with the result."</seg>
<seg id="46">Such was the case, by Jim Bruce, a writer from the state of Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but genitaliyami intermediate type.</seg>
<seg id="47">Doctors could not accurately determine whether he has had a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that he will never be able to live "a life of men."</seg>
<seg id="48">However shortly after his birth in 1976 external sexual organ and testicles Bruce were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">He began to give female hormones at the age of 12 years.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I knew that I was not a girl," he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But being in the Depression and understanding that something is wrong, he asked for medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">What he learned, it was terrible.</seg>
<seg id="55">I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about this.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development, which has kept his body to produce enough testosterone to normal development of genital mutilation.</seg>
<seg id="57">After learning the truth, he again became a man, taking testosterone injections and removing their breasts.</seg>
<seg id="58">The procedure made him sterile.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today, he performs in the defense of others in the organization called interface project, trying to bring in the normal perception of people with interseksualnostyu.</seg>
<seg id="60">But Ann temar-mettis, executive director of the California Association for legal advocates is informed choice, is concerned that the German law "urges naveshivaniyu labeling and stigma."</seg>
<seg id="61">"Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to take a hasty decision and give the child an uncertain" "floor," she said.</seg>
<seg id="62">We are afraid that he will contribute to the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="63">We believe that it is better to assign male or female gender, then to wait.</seg>
<seg id="64">But we have not seen this law would behave, so all that we can do is to make suppositions.</seg>
<seg id="65">Temar-mettis said her organization supports the Australian law, because "it allows adults to make choice in favor of the third floor."</seg>
<seg id="66">"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the formal sex," she says.</seg>
<seg id="67">German law implies its assigned at birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is a battle in which the small children should not enter at this stage.</seg>
<seg id="69">When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr Arlin Baratz, mammolog-rentgenolog from Pittsburgh, which has a daughter with violation of sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law "support" as parents, as well as children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Baratz daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but it has its violation of the sexual development called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. "</seg>
<seg id="72">Because its androgennye receptors work incorrectly, Katie have developed female characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="73">She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Now, at 29, Katie is married and studies in pediatric psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.</seg>
<seg id="75">Despite the fact that it barren, it hopes to become a parent via adoption or having gestational surrogate motherhood.</seg>
<seg id="76">"The law gives parents the time to not take any hasty decisions themselves," Baratz said.</seg>
<seg id="77">He gives them time to do any analysis or understand the situation, as well as the period of time before they write "male" and "female."</seg>
<seg id="78">In this case you in order — rastite baby love child.</seg>
<seg id="79">You have a lovely child, and you feel joy.</seg>
<seg id="80">We do not need to do the operation quickly, which is irreversible.</seg>
<seg id="81">"It allows children to participate in solving and eliminates the excitement that is driven by parents, because they do not feel that doing the right thing," she said.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the end the child decides what flooring him or her more comfortable — and that's fine.</seg>
<seg id="83">This gives children the opportunity to decide on their own.</seg>

<seg id="1">The court suspended the execution of the judgment on the practice of "ostanovit-i-obyskat" in the New York Police Department</seg>
<seg id="2">On Thursday, the court of appeal federal district has suspended enforcement of a court order demanding changes in the program "ostanovit-i-obyskat" of the New York Police Department, and the judge dismissed the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that Judge Sheindlin shiry execution of decisions will be suspended pending the results of an appeal lodged on the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">In August, a judge ruled that the city violated the Constitution in how he carried out the program for street detention and questioning.</seg>
<seg id="5">The city appealed the decision and the resolution on corrective measures, including a requirement to appoint the controller to help the police to change work practices and related training program.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard oral hearing on the request to suspend the case.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Court of Appeal has said about the need to remove judges because it violated the Code of Conduct for United States judges and't poschitalas with the need to avoid demonstrations of bias, in part because of a series of interviews to the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people unnecessarily turning to black and Hispanic on the program "ostanovit-i-obyskat."</seg>
<seg id="9">It has appointed external controller to oversee the far-reaching changes, which include reforms to the policies, training, and monitoring, and also agreed to launch a pilot program for testing zakreplyaemykh on body cameras in the police stations, where there is a majority of detentions.</seg>
<seg id="10">In August, New York came to the decision to cease the practice of storing the names and addresses of people, cases in which were stopped after a police investigation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Debate on appeal of the city should be held after March 14, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The tactic of stopping and searching" was criticised for many lawyers in civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Ostanovka-obysk" practiced for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops increased dramatically under the administration of an independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg's, reaching in 2011 in an absolute maximum 684 330 people, most of them black and Hispanic.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2004, four people, all — representatives of national minorities, have filed a class action in court.</seg>
<seg id="15">Supporters of the changes in the program "ostanovit-i-obyskat" in the New York Police Department say that these changes will end unfair practice, provide a more reliable and effective police service, and could affect how other departments of police carrying out the practice.</seg>
<seg id="16">Opponents argue that the change undermines the morale of the police, not the crime rate, would lead to unnecessary expenditure of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police due to the reduced number of officers at several thousand over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="17">The judge noted that it did not stop the practice of "ostanovit-i-obyskat" which complies with the constitution, but changes the way New York police stops of people.</seg>

<seg id="7">Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and surgery to remove cataracts, will help to overcome a backlog.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is also money for hospitals that accept patients without reservation, in Hobart and lonsestone, to improve the quality of care after in-patient, training medical professionals, mental health services and implementation of systems of personal electronic health cards in local hospitals.</seg>

<seg id="12">The Commission will be created from three people to make sure the state provides services as can be more efficient and more effective.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will solve nothing, if not "behind them will be followed by genuine reform, which would put the health care system Tasmania on a more sustainable basis."</seg>
<seg id="14">Nevertheless, he praised the government for a response to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first turned to the prime minister in early May.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I hope that the package of federal aid will significantly contribute to the conclusion of the health care system of this state from critical condition," said Mr Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the state government, these additional sampling procedures largely compensate for recent cuts.</seg>

<seg id="4">Obstructionism cannot serve as justification for the problems with the website reformiruemoy Obama health care system, drone attacks</seg>
<seg id="5">Memoirs of the Obama campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have been</seg>
<seg id="6">Nathaniel Morris p. - the second year student of medical faculty of Harvard University.</seg>
<seg id="7">I read a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
<seg id="8">I thought that this book will inspire me in times of gloom in the second year of medical faculty and restore in me a sense of hope.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is called "the impudence to win", and this memoir about the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I finish my evening to write reports on patients and go to bed, this book brings me back to the time when the policy inspired millions of people, and performances could capture the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Victory in the elections was formidable, and leading news programs did pause for reflection of this historical moment.</seg>
<seg id="12">My classmates crying with joy, and my parents who guarded all newspapers, which only they could find.</seg>
<seg id="13">The White House had come to a young team of strategists and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
<seg id="14">While Obama into office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.</seg>
<seg id="15">Then I close the book.</seg>
<seg id="16">Return to the present is a rude awakening, as vydergivanie from dreams.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="18">During the years that have passed since I dropped his first ballot, the changes actually occurred.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was that I could not even imagine.</seg>
<seg id="20">I give Obama credit for its large and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on available medical care to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the cancellation of the rules of "don't ask, not tell", the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, I believe that the party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, choice of public health and the closure of the base in Guantanamo, among others.</seg>
<seg id="22">But after innumerable number of times, when I was on the side of the Obama administration defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I have ended explanation, which I can provide.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have reached the point of political desperation.</seg>
<seg id="24">Republican obstructionism could not explain the permission to proslushku foreign leaders or drawing bespilotnikami strikes on innocent children in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">He could not explain to collect data about the private lives of Americans, the National Security Agency or persecution, razoblachiteley outlines government misconduct.</seg>
<seg id="26">He could not explain the murder of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Aulaqi without trial or failure to comply with the limits of public financing and spending during the presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="27">He cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that the prikladyvaemye White House efforts to silence the media, are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."</seg>
<seg id="28">And lately he cannot justify the fact that you cannot develop a simple Web site for more than three years after signing the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
<seg id="29">I do not know that I should have been expected.</seg>
<seg id="30">Should I was at the age of 18 years to understand that leadership may contradict the political campaigns that precede him?</seg>
<seg id="31">It is obvious that work on an elective office is not predictable programme of action, because our public dialogue will form the opposition political party and random events such as the carnage in Newtown.</seg>
<seg id="32">Yet for all the listed me above examples shows that they were largely his own choice of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="33">And that is what bothers me the most.</seg>
<seg id="34">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney was a strange and crass alternative, it seemed that he was not in a position to make a decision on their own policies or views.</seg>
<seg id="36">I thought that in his second term Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections meets hope, about which we have heard for so long.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, when this week, Obama's approval rating fell below 45 percent, to return to 2008 through this book has become much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">It makes me pine for many promises which uletuchilis.</seg>
<seg id="39">This week I read that part of the book, which describes how Obama, Clinton was deafening, defeated in the primary election in Pennsylvania.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the meeting on the analysis of the reasons of failures, he told his staff that they should go back to normal and remain faithful to its purpose.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I want us to have returned to our appeal," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day celebrations is unlikely to be the end of a znamenovat political struggle in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="3">Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when making oath, becoming the first freely elected president of the country, having replaced Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">He took the oath before 18 judges in black mantiyakh in court on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a ceremony shown live on state television.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life — absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, 60th engineer with American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, the fundamentalist group from which most of the 84 years of its existence was a banned organization, sluzhivshey target for tough action by successive governments.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived with a small kortezhem shortly after 11 a.m. local time.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the court building to greet the new president, and, unlike the presidential fanfare since Mubarak, the movement was stopped only for a short period of time to miss his convoy on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although Morsi ridiculed as "nekharizmatichnoe spare wheel" "Brothers", his personal prestige has soared since his victory and Friday's speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only Islamists, but also all those who want to bring the matter before the end of the 2011 uprising against Mubarak's authoritarian rule.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi said, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, judges in obshitom wooden panels hall where he took the oath of office.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he had to pronounce its inauguratsionnuyu speech.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was be provided the official reception with army orchestra ispolnivshim national anthem during which he stood by the "quiet."</seg>
<seg id="14">Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, attended military figure.</seg>
<seg id="15">His arrival was greeted with the slogan "the army and the people are one hand," who chanted hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.</seg>
<seg id="16">Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s, became a stronghold of Islamist student groups.</seg>
<seg id="17">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising began, zavershivshee Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers, which his office was deprived of the military council that has made the case against the deposed leader.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by agreeing to take the oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he performs the will of the military, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatres with populist gestures.</seg>

<seg id="1">The recognition of the National Security Agency reinforce the paranoia of corporations to state surveillance</seg>
<seg id="2">Warm day in late August, German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the Federal Service for the protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence service, its mission was to photograph the roof of the building, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="4">German media say the BfV had hoped to discover the intelligence listening devices, and these actions led to the talks between the US and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Klepper, director of national intelligence, in September, again assured that the United States will not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits. "</seg>
<seg id="6">But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became razoblachitelem — began to publish your Treasury intelligence secrets to the United States, European governments and executives no longer sure whether to trust the director on the word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to the data stored in the cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoia of corporations, persecution by the state, to new heights.</seg>
<seg id="8">The last straw was the news that the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel, perhaps, auditioned about ten years.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the most influential person of Europe can become a target, you are, of course, potential targets and business leaders.</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden made an obvious intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the United States and companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is quite likely that this data is used for mutual gain.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, the president of the Association of bitmi, which represents small and medium-sized it-company of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">German companies believe the US now poses almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July consulting agency EY.</seg>
<seg id="14">In all the documents, uncovered by Mr. snoudenom, nevertheless, has so far had no evidence that the United States passed the trade secrets of foreign companies in their own companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks a certain possibilities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the opinion that he should try to reduce its dependence on the US.</seg>
<seg id="16">Businessmen are skeptical of that.</seg>
<seg id="17">Someone in the German Parliament says that we must create a Google.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can only slowly close your eyes and open them again …</seg>
<seg id="19">"This is not an option," says Gasso Plattner, president of the German company's SAP software for business.</seg>
<seg id="20">If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, not have to allow her to die over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">All is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.</seg>
<seg id="22">All, apart from the IT industry.</seg>
<seg id="23">And yet the scope and the technical development of espionage agencies of the United States, which had become famous thanks to revelations snoudena, were a shock for some companies who had previously thought that the greatest risk of exposure is China.</seg>
<seg id="24">A big shift is happening in cloud technologies, where leaders of European companies better realized that data stored in the United States, are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-American members abandoned plans to use facilities located in the United States, the cloud provider after revelations of U.S. data mining programme Prism.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim sneyb, one of the SAP Executive Board, said: "We are seeing that consumers are asking a new question, which has not occurred a year ago, namely: where are my data and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this jurisdiction."</seg>
<seg id="27">Many German leaders argue that the last message — this is just confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and, consequently, these data should be protected at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="28">What is economic espionage, is no surprise.</seg>
<seg id="29">He always had a place.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This has been a subject of discussion for many years and not changed substantially in the current debate," says Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of chemical company BASF.</seg>
<seg id="31">Americans shpionyat for us on the commercial and industrial level, and we too shpionim behind them, because it is in our national interests, protect our commercial ventures.</seg>
<seg id="32">Leaders of corporations typically do not like to boast of the retaliation they have taken, as this can provide an advantage to the enemy.</seg>
<seg id="33">In large companies have long been usvoena thought that take free USB drive at the exhibition or leave your laptop unattended in the hotel room is at least imprudently.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ulrich khakenberg, member of the board of directors of car company Audi, says that for many years it is standard practice — collect mobile phones before board meetings, so they could not be used as podslushivayushchie device.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Federal Office for the protection of the Constitution, Germany recommends that managers of companies consider the use of simple pre-paid mobile phones during foreign trips because of the vulnerability of smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="36">Prepaid mobile phones subsequently blown.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nevertheless, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to vzlomov and surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their particular niche.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources in order to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," warns in the report of the BfV.</seg>
<seg id="40">The United States warned their own companies about economic espionage from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="41">The US national intelligence summary in February placed France along with Israel and Russia in the second series of offenders involved in khakerstvom for economic intelligence, after China, says the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="42">A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when talking about economic espionage, the French are the worst of all. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Syria destroyed all the declared facilities for production of chemical weapons, recognized by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.</seg>
<seg id="3">This first stage of disarmament Damascus finished the day before the deadline.</seg>
<seg id="4">Until 1 November Syria was to destroy the manufacturing and other auxiliary objects intended for combat training in the use of toxic substances, reports the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="5">The destruction of the stockpile of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by the middle of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the representative of the OPCW, currently toxic substances are in opechatannykh repositories.</seg>
<seg id="7">International inspectors went to Syria after on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August in the chemical attack were killed, according to the United States, more than 1,400 people.</seg>
<seg id="8">The main task of the inspectors was not lose time to not allow Syrian authorities to produce more khimoruzhiya - and destroy infrastructure equipment for mixing chemicals and munitions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Behind these manufacturing facilities will now be watching carefully to prevent their repair.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next milestone is the middle of November: By this time the OPCW and Syria must agree to a detailed plan of destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="11">A lot of questions here.</seg>
<seg id="12">Where will they be removed?</seg>
<seg id="13">Who will provide the equipment for this?</seg>
<seg id="14">All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western razvedsluzhbami.</seg>
<seg id="15">They readily'll inspectors new objects to test if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not fully candid.</seg>
<seg id="16">The United States believed that the shelling was held regular troops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Syria and Russia insist that this was the work of the Syrian rebels.</seg>
<seg id="18">The world community has demanded from the Syrian leadership is in accordance with the agreement reached by mediated by Russia, is to destroy or lead in inoperable all capacity for the production of shells, toxic gases and liquids and shells for filling in these substances.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when this phase passed, the next step must be to destroy existing the Syrian army khimoruzhiya.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is assumed that this could be Arsenal more than 1,000 tons of toxic substances kozhno-naryvnogo nervno-paraliticheskikh, mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places.</seg>
<seg id="21">For its destruction is necessary to the OPCW and the Syrian authorities for the agreed timetable of action - it is two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">The head of the OPCW field operations Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "personally watched the destruction of the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Now they have no opportunity to conduct further production or mixing chemical weapons," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the statement, the OPCW said its inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and convinced US factories on manufacture of shells and toxic substances, either destroyed or are in order.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: the gap with Europe gives shotlandtsam choice</seg>
<seg id="2">Another day, another strashilka on independence.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time, we warn that an independent Scotland should join the European free movement area as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's turn stories about passport control in bervike and the border with barbed wire along Adrianova shaft.</seg>
<seg id="5">True, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to possible economic benefits from the more liberal movements in the rest of Europe, though — predictably — not that it has appeared in headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nobody't also pointed out that the EU Member States spend a lot of time to turn their formal rules as it is convenient.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because Scotland is not included in the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance with the requirements will become cheap concession to Brussels in return for what he truly wanted from the Scots.</seg>
<seg id="8">So this is not the story one worthy of attention.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so old that she has become a fossil: I first heard "duck" about what "independence means passport control," at least 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">And yet there is an interesting point, lost when pereskaze ancient tales.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why does an independent Scotland should comply with orders in Europe?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why change the yoke of London on the yoke of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is a real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe finally stalled.</seg>
<seg id="14">With evrokrizisom project "Europe" is officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">Across the European Union the party opposed the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency, gaining strength.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany, "euro-skeptics party Alternative for Germany, founded only this year — appeared from nowhere and won nearly five million votes in the September federal election, thus displacing essentially" free Democrats "(the equivalent of" our ") Liberal Democrats, from the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was always the internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.</seg>
<seg id="19">Austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of the common currency have led many people to believe that the project "Europe" has gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The euro crisis is connected with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits — this was true only for Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact evrosistema blocked its members on favorable exchange rates, for German exporters, is that German politicians and want to preserve.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency in southern Europe is at a disadvantage in advance of production capacities in comparison with Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only means of spasitelnoe — to cut wages and government spending that actively supported by Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">For the current budget problems and exchange is a much deeper problem of the productive capacities of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of measures to "green" energy, embedded Brussels subsidies — a cipher for French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers, European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times more for gas than in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="26">This paralizuyushche adverse price terms, as we have already seen in greyndzhmute.</seg>
<seg id="27">No freezing wages in the world does not stop overwhelming victory of cheap shale gas in the United States over European petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result of the rebellion is brewing, especially in France, once the most yaroy storonnitse EU.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on one level with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Berlin no longer needed in Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy of Europe, leaving the destroyed the economy of France in distress.</seg>
<seg id="31">The result — right, acting against the EU party Marine Le Pen of the National Front "just won the decisive run-off election by discarding the ruling Party of Socialists into third place.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The front line" is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote — a timely warning the British that it would not proceed from the assumption that the split among the right effect automatically in favor of the left.</seg>
<seg id="33">What makes Le Pen with their newly inherited popularity among French white working class?</seg>
<seg id="34">She wants to use the elections to the EU in the next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.</seg>
<seg id="35">If — and it is very likely — opposed to EU parties will receive support in this election, this unit will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="36">Here is my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The EU will not go away, but he again becomes something of a "vague Europe (sovereign) nations," which like General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and several economies dependent on it can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore its own currency.</seg>
<seg id="39">I assume that Britain distances himself from the project, hoping to get closer to the US.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, the growing interest from Washington to the Pacific Ocean indicates the likelihood that Britain will be left without attention into the cold Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="41">In what position it leaves Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can choose to become a region (essentially) of England.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can to protect their own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send the Berlin and Brussels to hell in a handbasket.</seg>
<seg id="44">I suspect that Scotland can succeed in the freer European agreement provided that we will keep its currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Cooperation with other stranami-edinomyshlennikami will be easier in Europe nefederalnoy nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of Norway and preserve our economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">The government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is — ironically — the most successful political movement in Europe, and against the austerity measures, which received a majority of the votes in 2011 due to objections against cuts proposed (and sold) Labour Chancellor Exchequer Aleister darlingom and subsequently raised by the coalition of Tories and Liberal Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="48">Scotland would be ludicrous now to vote for independence, only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">Early puberty: Aging earlier</seg>
<seg id="2">Afroamerikanskie and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white sverstnitsy, studies show.</seg>
<seg id="3">Physical changes do not mean that puberty close</seg>
<seg id="4">There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the mechanisms of early puberty</seg>
<seg id="6">The trend toward early puberty is not so pronounced in boys</seg>
<seg id="7">Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">Whether the mother pugatsya if her daughter had begin to form the beginnings of the breast and pubic hair grow at 7 or 8 years?</seg>
<seg id="9">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endokrinolog Dr. Paul kaplovitts explained that these early physical changes is quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I spend a lot of time, calming parents — usually it does not mean the rapid advance of full sexual maturity," said kaplovitts.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts and pubic hair Axillaries are and smell the body appear earlier in girls.</seg>
<seg id="12">But it was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first period) over the last four decades.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States, the average age of 12.5 years and decreased compared with 12,75 in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"After chest begins to develop, is at least two to three years before menarche", — said kaplovitts, who is also the author of "early puberty in girls: how to cope with this widespread problem."</seg>
<seg id="15">Time is the most accurate check of how puberty will prosper.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is debate about what constitutes an offensive sexual maturity, but is considered "premature" when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp rise in growth to 8 years.</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases, the process will slow or be — is what the pediatrician can monitor carefully.</seg>
<seg id="18">More rapid progress can serve as the basis for analyses have endokrinologa to avoid serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which ultimately can lead to slow growth and low growth in adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy is based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kaplovitts cautious with drugs, but acknowledges that the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers. "</seg>
<seg id="23">Another big problem is clear: parents simply do not want them to have very young daughters were menstruation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They worry about the risks of pregnancy, or even about how they cope with hygiene issues," said kaplovitts.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was a shock," recalls one woman, the daughter of menstruation, which started in 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.</seg>
<seg id="27">She came home from school, fearful and broken that it first among his friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are many razreklamirovannykh theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual statements in the media.</seg>
<seg id="30">The boys — like girls, puberty begins earlier.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplovitts argues that the premise, which has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country and afroamerikanskie Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white sverstnitsy.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are various explanations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Around the world, on early puberty, apparently affects everything from economic conditions and climate change to genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Another mystery: Although boys have hair on the face and on Lobke appear at younger ages, a trend to complete it early sex not as pronounced as in girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other physicians participating in the Conference of the AAP, confirmed the complexity of this subject.</seg>
<seg id="39">The emergence of pimples and pubic hair found even in infants and children of nursery age.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We must be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Laurence Silverman, child endokrinolog at children's Hospital in gorieb g. The Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from a pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It may mean an earlier than expected, conversation," explained kaplovitts.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you keep calm, your child normally reacts well.</seg>
<seg id="44">Girls that blossom early, you need proof that even when it happens early, this process is a normal part of life.</seg>

<seg id="24">According to him, the program of the trip are still at the development stage.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although Murphy has said that the goal of the trip is to improve relations, he said that "a degree of rigidity well-meaning" will emerge.</seg>
<seg id="26">He said that European leaders must be honest with his people in what spyware programs they have used for many years.</seg>
<seg id="27">"While we can change our tracking program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only people involved in intelligence activities," Murphy said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile, Mr Kerry will head into this weekend in the Middle East and in Poland for solving the problems of hostility against the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, but also the United States intelligence activity.</seg>

<seg id="6">However, statistics show that I am a white crow in regard to Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year, and spend a total of $6.9 billion on costumes, candy, and decorations.</seg>
<seg id="8">The only thing I wait every Halloween is trending.</seg>
<seg id="9">The National Retail Federation predicts that the suits will be spent $1.2 billion from $6.9 billion.</seg>
<seg id="10">This year, at the height of fashion sexual inanimate objects.</seg>
<seg id="11">Women no longer need to be members of the professions of sex; they can also be sexual food such as pizza, gamburgerami or morkovkami.</seg>
<seg id="12">As for the men, I think we will see a lot of zombie thanks "khodyachim mertvetsam", and I am confident that the astronauts in the style of the band Daft Punk tapes to be in our 11 this year.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Google, the costumes, which are most often is a zombie, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>
<seg id="14">Perhaps, there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.</seg>
<seg id="15">We naryadili our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.</seg>
<seg id="16">Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans spend this year, $330 million on costumes for pets.</seg>

<seg id="2">In Lombard in shopping mall in Singapore bendemir dzhanani amirtkhalinga lays the golden bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for the education of his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"My husband and I just bought a house so that all my money is invested there," said Ms. amirtkhalinga.</seg>
<seg id="4">Though she earns s $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, a monthly family income is not enough, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia — where the debt of households is growing — is that ValueMax where she spends her deal this week became the third lombardom registered on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Credit under pledge of jewellery is not just a quick way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. amirtkhalinga), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="7">Usually there are pawnbrokers in Singapore in an effective annual interest rate of 17% — slightly above the 15.4% offered in the United Overseas Bank, a local lender, with a branch in the same shopping center.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or evidence of wage and can give loans faster than banks.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers, as households feel the pressure because of the rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.</seg>
<seg id="10">After five years of robust growth, following the global financial crisis and cheap credit, podpityvavshikhsya loose monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers, to compensate for the decrease in revenues as the slowing growth of their economies.</seg>
<seg id="11">This week, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency ,'s indicated an increase in household leverage, mainly due to the growth of the mortgage, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.</seg>
<seg id="12">It announced that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, compared with 60% in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="14">Economists also worry about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely emerged from technical recession.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The bottom line is that people with higher prices in the middle and bottom of the income scale] [will look for ways to supplement their incomes where only able," says Song Seng Vun, economist at CIMB, the Malaysian bank.</seg>
<seg id="17">Record high gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the IBSC Board with which people lay their personal belongings as they use to get money for their own family decorations.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Singapore, about 70% of the things contained in paragraphs 200 lombardnykh city-state's--are gold products.</seg>
<seg id="19">People say: "The price of gold looks good, let us zalozhim gold chain of grandmothers and get it back in the next month."</seg>
<seg id="20">In Thailand, the largest operator of pawn shops EasyMoney observed an increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.</seg>
<seg id="21">Growth in business lombardnom is that ValueMax, operator of the bendemire and 15 other similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside of Asia, too, says yeakh Lee Ching, executive director of ValueMax.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company will finance the expansion, with 60 per cent of S $66 million raised this week as a result of placement of shares on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="23">While some lenders have sparked the fire of critics because of high interest rates, Ms. Lombard yeakh says that not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase the debt directly.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Clients lay items which they already possess, and monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households," she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">Bet wins wider public recognition as a means to obtain short-term secured funding.</seg>
<seg id="26">And while lombardami enjoyed not only those categories of people who are in a precarious financial position.</seg>
<seg id="27">Rich people in Singapore also use of ValueMax, laying gold ingots or a Rolex, who can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
<seg id="28">We are seeing clients from all sectors of society.</seg>
<seg id="29">"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short period of time for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses, which need to be overcome temporary financial difficulties," said Ms. yeakh.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sometimes they simply needed money very quickly.</seg>

<seg id="1">You have a black box in your car?</seg>
<seg id="2">While American designers roads trying to find money to repair highways rassypayushcheysya system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box, neatly pristroennom on the dashboard of your car.</seg>
<seg id="3">These devices, tracking every proezzhaemuyu avtomobilistom mile and transmit this information to officials, are at the center of the controversial attempts to modernize the antiquated system of financing the highways of America by routine by Washington and the states.</seg>
<seg id="4">Usually a boring arena highways planning suddenly gave rise to intense debate and romantic alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying the government for the right to use the small design to track the number of miles you proezzhaemykh and even, perhaps, the one where you drive them - and then use this information when drawing up the tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tea Party movement in shock.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Liberties Union also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about private life.</seg>
<seg id="8">And although until Congress can agree to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.</seg>
<seg id="9">They ponder how over the next decade, you can go to the system, under which drivers pay for each mile road, which they can ride.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motorists had taken for testing these black boxes, some of which have a function of satellite tracking.</seg>
<seg id="11">Is it really necessary for our country.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This is not an issue on which we have may be the right choice," said Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which trains plans to start tracking the state authorities miles proezzhaemykh every Californian avtomobilistom, by 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">The technology to do this already exists.</seg>
<seg id="15">The need for this is aggravated by a lack of funds from the government fund the construction of highways, funded by taxes that Americans pay on avtozapravkakh.</seg>
<seg id="16">Americans are not buying as much gasoline as before.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars passing more miles on one gallon.</seg>
<seg id="18">The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, not Rose for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Politicians do not want to raise the tax by even one cent at high gasoline prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">"A tax on gasoline simply impossible to maintain," said Li Mannich, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">In his state was recently installed on the cars of 500 tracking devices for testing the system pomilnoy payment.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It would be the best option in the long run," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Call it the beggar pomilnoy user fee.</seg>
<seg id="24">Not surprisingly, this idea appeals to urban liberals, because with the help of taxes can be changed the nature of travel for reducing road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.</seg>
<seg id="25">Authorities planned in California could be waiting for this system in the development of strategies to achieve the ambitious targets set by the laws of this state to combat global warming.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, a Republican member of the House of Representatives Bill Shuster (Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said that he, too, sees the system as the most viable long-term alternatives.</seg>
<seg id="27">Advocates of the free market to fund "reason" also delighted from what drivers would pay for each mile.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It is not just a tax which will go into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs of reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">People directly pay for what they receive.</seg>
<seg id="30">This movement also is supported by two former ministers of transport of the United States, which in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction of pomilnoy payment.</seg>
<seg id="31">The US Senate approved last year in a pilot project at a cost of 90 million dollars, which would have involved about 10,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="32">But leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal due to fears of rural legislators representing voters who in everyday life have often come many miles to get to work or to the city.</seg>
<seg id="33">A few states and cities, nevertheless, go on that path independently.</seg>
<seg id="34">The greatest enthusiasm proyavlyaetsya in Oregon, where for participation in the largest experiment in the country get 5,000 drivers.</seg>
<seg id="35">These drivers will soon be paying staff for miles driven instead of the tax on gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Nevada, a pilot project has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="37">In New York, he is seen.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois oprobuet it on a limited basis involving lorries.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes departments of transport 17 states of the East Coast (including Maryland, pensilvaniyu, virdzhiniyu and Florida), studying how they can spend these changes.</seg>
<seg id="40">This concept has not received universal acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government can track their every step.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Concerns about the" big brother "and such things is a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of the issues of strategy and management efficiency at the Department for Transport, the state of Nevada.</seg>
<seg id="43">It was not what people wanted.</seg>
<seg id="44">When the tests were underway, a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: "will be very easy to convert these devices in full tracking devices."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no need to create a huge, huge technological infrastructure, which will inevitably be extended for the storage of records about the everyday movements of individual citizens.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is one of several states where we are soul searching low-cost technology that would allow authorities to keep state accounting proezzhaemykh car miles, but no information about the place and time.</seg>
<seg id="47">If you can do it, Khan said, society will feel more calm.</seg>
<seg id="48">The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called true mileage.</seg>
<seg id="49">Initially, this company has been attempting to collect state taxes.</seg>
<seg id="50">She sought to enter the booming market of automobile insurance, in which drivers pay based on mileage.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the device, which it began testing, attract designers roads because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically loaded with modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">"People will be more inclined to do it if you do not track their speed and does not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, executive director of the true mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">It was a few big mistakes in some of these pilot programs in the state.</seg>
<seg id="54">There is much less expensive and less recurring ways to do it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Drivers in Oregon designers are experimenting with provision of various options.</seg>
<seg id="56">They can choose the device with or without GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or they could just abandon devices, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that can ride all residents of the state.</seg>
<seg id="58">In other places, they hope to sell the idea of nastorozhennoy public, forcing the device to do more, not less.</seg>
<seg id="59">The New York City transportation officials are seeking to develop nalogooblagayushchee device which will also take payment for parking lot meters, to provide "pay as ezdish" insurance pool and gather data about the speed in real time from other drivers, and that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Motorists will involve the benefits they offer," the document says urban design.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some designers transport systems, however, think about not whether all talk about paying a huge pomilnoy just a distraction.</seg>
<seg id="62">In urban transport commission in the San Francisco Bay area officials say that Congress could easily overcome bankruptcy trust fund the construction of highways, raising taxes on gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="63">An additional lump sum or annual tax would charge drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline that they paid their fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">"There is no need for radical surgical intervention, when all you need to do is take an aspirin," said Randy rentshler, director of the Commission on legislation and public relations.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about his private life, and many other things.</seg>

<seg id="4">Currently there are 201 Cardinal.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, after the Cardinal 80th age he can no longer take part in the election of the Pope is a prerogative of the 120 "kardinalov-vyborshchikov."</seg>
<seg id="6">Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony will be held at San meeting all current Cardinals, known as konsistoriya.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Pope Francis decided to inform us of its decision to convene konsistoriyu in February in order to facilitate planning of other meetings with the participation of the cardinals from all over the world," said Lombardi.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices, "said that by February number kardinalov-vyborshchikov will likely fall.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that usually the Pope calls cardinals as much as necessary to again bring the number of kardinalov-vyborshchikov to 120, and so the Cardinals over the age of 80 years as he chooses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Konsistoriya next year will have great significance because it will be the first since the election of Francis, in March of this year, according to Valero.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the moment there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It will be interesting to see whether the Cardinals would appoint the new pope from other regions of the world to restore the balance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">In South America, home to 40 percent of Catholics, but they are insignificant number of cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">It will also be the first selected Cardinals since the formation of the Council of Cardinals Francis — the group of eight cardinals from around the world, which is to seek ways of reforming the church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past, the Pope decided everything themselves.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now that Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that "it is entirely possible" that Francis will turn to kardinalam for advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">But we have not been in this situation before that — all of it for us for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valero said the pope usually built in the position of cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis "full of surprises — however we do not know whom he names."</seg>

<seg id="8">In October, launched a new mill, which helps increase the product range.</seg>
<seg id="9">The plant produces a fine profile of pipes, which is used for tep-lichnogo farms, small forms of construction and furniture industries, as well as large - for the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="10">Plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousands tons of production per year, which would be about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the transition to another activity, the number of employees at the plant decreased't - now it is 157 people in plans for the purchase of new equipment, increased staff even more than 50 employees.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the enterprise there is a retraining of the staff and the experts are from existing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Next year we plan to introduce the new unit longitudinal cutting of the steel with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which would reduce the cost of production, and another camp, with the speed of the production of pipes to 47 meters per minute.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the end of 2014, at the company are going to master production of tubes, which are used in the housing and public utility sector.</seg>
<seg id="15">The company aims to close to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tyumen region in this production.</seg>
<seg id="16">The deputy director of the Department of investment policy Leonid Ostroumov, referring to the leaders of manufacturing, and advised to focus on modernization of machine-building enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="17">To this aim, and forms of state support for industry, which include compensation for interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the current year to allocate for these purposes provided for 150 mln rubles, two-thirds of that amount has already been spent.</seg>
<seg id="19">The latest commission, which will consider the subsidy contracts, taking documents from companies until 15 November.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, the budget are reimbursed expenses for the participation of local manufacturers in international fairs.</seg>
<seg id="21">The budget for the coming year provides the means of 150 million rubles, which can be used to offset leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.</seg>
<seg id="22">5 Million will be allocated to participate in trade fairs, 3 million - on energy efficiency programme.</seg>
<seg id="23">Falling to 72 million roubles of funds for compensation ordered and paid for equipment, which is produced in the south of Tyumen region for oil and gas complex.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Leonid Ostroumova, in the long term, this form of support will be stopped, as motive for her compensation was the introduction of a tax on mining, which oil companies paid to the local budget.</seg>
<seg id="25">Currently they do not become subsidies and direct supply obligations in the region.</seg>
<seg id="26">In view of this, the government believes the priority directly support of industrial enterprises, rather than financing them through the oil industry.</seg>
<seg id="27">The aid budget will be associated with investment projects which will be implemented on the production.</seg>
<seg id="28">Many business executives expressed concern in connection with the situation in relations with have claimed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Bailout on their zakupaemoe equipment industry is competitive advantage and the South of Tyumen region, with its repeal is hard to compete on price with an average strip of Russia, where more than cheap labor.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, the question of succession is unclear with the new owner of TNK-BP - Rosneft company, which does not yet place their orders for the Tyumen enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="31">The agreement on implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and his request for an extension was not received.</seg>
<seg id="32">Currently, the Enterprise South area who specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the next year.</seg>
<seg id="33">There remains an open question whether taxes will come from oil extracted in uvatskom area in the budget of the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the deposits.</seg>

<seg id="5">The deadline of 1 November, installed this organisation based in The Hague to Damascus destroyed or "made nerabotosposobnymi" all the means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms that allow chemicals to mix with the acquisition of poison gas and filling munitions with them.</seg>
<seg id="6">The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by the middle of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="7">The destruction of the equipment means Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="8">Yet Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.</seg>
<seg id="9">The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemical agents and weapons, including agents mustard gas and make nerve gas sarin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report: Obama election staff viewed the exclusion of Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the New York Times, the closest advisers of President Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden candidacy of Hillary Clinton in the voter list of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">This discovery is the most spectacular sensation of all books expected Mark Galperin and John khaylemanna on campaign 2012 "rates udvoeny: Game Change 2012".</seg>
<seg id="4">The upcoming edition of The Times received a copy of the book to the exit and reported on Thursday night that close aides of the president held a "large-scale research in a focus group and opinion polls at the end of 2011," to assess whether the exclusion of Biden help raise ugasayushchie hopes for Obama's re-election.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the political observer the Times Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts by senior officials, campaign staff and the White House, namely the former White House chief of staff Bill Daley to assess what effect the vote will have on the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton's vice-president.</seg>
<seg id="6">Possible replacement was a mystery, carefully guarded election headquarters in Chicago and in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only six of the president's closest advisers — including Daly, the former head of Obama's campaign staff Jim messinu and former senior White House advisers David akselroda and David pluffa — knew that replacement considered.</seg>
<seg id="8">The book "rates udvoeny" argues that Daly was the initiator attempts to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationship", but ultimately abandoned this step when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list is not "significantly improves the chances of Obama."</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview with Martin Daly confirmed that the administration really considered to replace Biden Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I was actively spoken out for consideration of many things, and this was one of them," said the daily newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="11">You must remember that at that point the president was in awful shape, so we thought: "Oh God, what do we do?"</seg>
<seg id="12">Although Daly described the study as "necessary" test representative, Martin told CNN that Anderson kuperu election staff enough was invested in the study, whether this step dividends on a vote.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Campaign headquarters are not spending such sums of money on surveys and focus groups if they do not consider something seriously," said Martin in the AK 360.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team studied the possibility of replacement.</seg>
<seg id="15">Martin told CNN that he asked Daley knew whether his then boss about possible peretasovke.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although Daly and said that he did not think the president "was aware" of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration acknowledged that "perhaps", Obama knew.</seg>
<seg id="17">Martin added that rates "udvoeny" does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political table've sensing to Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooper asked Martin, seriously whether he believes that Obama did not know about the research capabilities of excluded Biden from the electoral list.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Perhaps," Martin said.</seg>

<seg id="3">According to their prikidkam, consumption of beer in the country in the coming year will remain at the same level, and it is at best.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although businessmen initially counted on growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the current year is unfortunate for them: sales fell by 7 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why would the construction of the TPU in Moscow</seg>
<seg id="2">With each passing year, city authorities promise to arrange more transportno-peresadochnykh knots (TPU).</seg>
<seg id="3">Until 2020, it is planned to enter into operation 255 TPU.</seg>
<seg id="4">What actually is the project of understanding our correspondent.</seg>
<seg id="5">A couple of months ago the Smolenskaya metro "" arbatsko-pokrovskoy line a construction fence.</seg>
<seg id="6">The caption read, which is construction of the project's funding has node.</seg>
<seg id="7">All this was very strange because near Smolensk "" no land transport does not stop and, therefore, cannot move on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, one must overcome about 130 meters, including land crossing karmanitskiy Lane.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now the Smolensk "" almost all finished.</seg>
<seg id="10">Faded flower stall, demontirovan stand for newspapers, and the pavement in front of the entrance to bruschatkoy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Here is the entire transport hub.</seg>
<seg id="12">Transportno-peresadochnye nodes are ploskostnymi and capital - explain in the press service of the Moscow Department of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="13">Capital TPU while are not present.</seg>
<seg id="14">But ploskostnye suggest the construction of the parking lots of shopping sites, hindering the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="15">Actually, even ploskostnymi TPU do not forwarding company and professional blagoustroiteli overhaul of Department of the city of Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hub is not necessarily a complicated structure, explains the director of Institute of Economy of transport and the transport policy of the Higher School of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sometimes a roof over his head and the scoreboard, opoveshchayushchikh about the time of arrival of transport.</seg>
<seg id="18">Here, for example, the Metro "Yasenevo" recently opened a full-fledged ploskostnoy interchange junction.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even without the canopies, but with perekhvatyvayushchimi car parks and the scoreboard indicating when pridet bus.</seg>
<seg id="20">But in pursuit of the record number of officials at TPU all that neither Popadya.</seg>
<seg id="21">Back in 2011, City Hall planned to build at all about all 151 node, 59 of them with capital construction.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now, in plans by 2020, there are as many as 255 TPU.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some 200 of them even promise to pass this year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the city has the program of development of TPU't indicated no qualitative criteria - notes Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "city and transport".</seg>
<seg id="25">Report on the number of objects, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often deteriorates.</seg>
<seg id="26">The criteria, according to the expert, there must be two: first - cutting the time of transplant, second, convenience.</seg>
<seg id="27">First of all an opportunity to change the type of transport, not going out in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Moscow the same by arrangement of the TPU sometimes goes in exactly the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="29">A vivid example of Metro VDNKh "".</seg>
<seg id="30">Earlier, commuter buses to the Yaroslavsky highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now they have to stop on the opposite side of the street yaroslavki cosmonauts.</seg>
<seg id="32">Farther from the subway, much further from monorelsa, but closer to residential homes.</seg>
<seg id="33">The gift that residents do not want bus under Windows and complained in every possible instance.</seg>
<seg id="34">With capital TPU in Moscow did not immediately zadalos.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first of them started five years ago, the subway "Planernaya".</seg>
<seg id="36">The project aims to be a model.</seg>
<seg id="37">And really it was an example of how interchange node, left to extremely investoram, turns into a banal shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="38">No, there are canopy perrony for buses, not to go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.</seg>
<seg id="39">True, khimkinskim trolleybusam № № 202 and 203 seats in Moscow will not give fundamentally.</seg>
<seg id="40">How strange they pushed them away from the Metro.</seg>
<seg id="41">But the space under the trade more left.</seg>
<seg id="42">One of only 32 clothing store, and generally have almost everything - from pet products to the showroom.</seg>
<seg id="43">Well, in fact, who suddenly from bus passengers need to buy a new car on the road?</seg>
<seg id="44">We have, when building overhaul TPU, somehow always turns out shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="45">Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion, when part of the building decided to give at the market.</seg>
<seg id="46">Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planernaya" among razmechennykh parking spaces on the floor goes boykaya trade.</seg>
<seg id="47">Chinese vegetables, spices, jeans, not Russian speech and security guards, angrily poglyadyvayushchie on our photographer.</seg>
<seg id="48">Interchange knot finally turned into a bazaar.</seg>
<seg id="49">The fact of the matter is that before the Metro "Planernaya" was market, but his demolished.</seg>
<seg id="50">And in the prefecture of traffickers and everything within DUI allowed on perekhvatyvayushchuyu parking peresadochnogo node.</seg>
<seg id="51">Still, because of the high prices there are always empty.</seg>
<seg id="52">The same ridiculous that the market demolished in order to build in its place... a new ploskostnoy TPU.</seg>
<seg id="53">This is castling.</seg>
<seg id="54">The Kaluzhskaya Metro "" distance approach from lobby Metro bus was 50 meters, says Alexander Morozov.</seg>
<seg id="55">After the construction of the trade center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.</seg>
<seg id="56">To sit in the bus, it is necessary to pass through the shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="57">After 22 hours, when it is closed, must work around him under the open sky.</seg>
<seg id="58">However, construction on "planernoy" and "Kaluga" soon look like the problem.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the middle of September, the Commission approved gradostroitelno-zemelnaya mayor planning solutions for the first eight Capital TPU.</seg>
<seg id="60">Four of them will be 25-etazhnymi, not counting two or three underground lines.</seg>
<seg id="61">The monster will grow the Metro "Tushino", there will be 418,7 thousand square metres of space.</seg>
<seg id="62">Representatives of railway stations Directorate of Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of the TPU from Metro, already told journalists: in future mnogoetazhkakh will contain shops, hotels and apartments.</seg>
<seg id="63">At the same time, officials claim that storied parking Zay ­ Mut from one third to a half square.</seg>
<seg id="64">Take for example the "folk" garages.</seg>
<seg id="65">For example, the garage for 258 mashino-mest, which recently built on the international street, has an area of 8015 square meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">That means, for the thousands of car parking in 2.6 "'ve petrovsko-razumovskoy" need on the order of 80,000 "" squares.</seg>
<seg id="67">This is less than a third of the makhiny, which gather there to build.</seg>
<seg id="68">Let one or two floors will be spent on various perrony for buses.</seg>
<seg id="69">Remains of at least 150 thousand square metres of commercial real estate.</seg>
<seg id="70">And this, in a minute, almost two Pishan County.</seg>
<seg id="71">If capital TPU at stations and railroad station building, the rest of the site will explore metropolitenovtsy.</seg>
<seg id="72">They also promised that there will be a lot of objects "" functional purpose, including hotels, offices and even sports halls.</seg>
<seg id="73">By the way, in the Moscow department of property recently, told journalists that developing a draft decree, under which investors would be able to apply for a plot for TPU directly to the officials.</seg>
<seg id="74">Without any competitions.</seg>
<seg id="75">Because, they say, that the transport issues for the city - a priority.</seg>
<seg id="76">The ideal TPU is, for example, the Harvard "" in Boston or "spadayna" in Toronto, is confident Alexander Morozov.</seg>
<seg id="77">There, trolleys and trams descend underground to the Metro and the distance from the approach of subway cars before the tram is only 50 metres without access to the street.</seg>
<seg id="78">Around no unnecessary trade.</seg>
<seg id="79">But Moscow officials throws in the extreme.</seg>
<seg id="80">Either we will build nothing, or too otgrokhaem 25 storeys with offices and apartments.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bombardier profit declines with falling supplies and more orders for planes</seg>
<seg id="2">Corporation of Bombardier, the Canadian aircraft and train maker, reported on Thursday a net profit reduction on the 15 percent under the influence of umenshivshegosya quantity of orders and deliveries aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division.</seg>
<seg id="3">Located in Montreal, Bombardier also has not published any data for flight testing of its new CSeries aircraft and provided no new information about whether implemented ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation by next September.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the first flight of a prototype of the aircraft, held about six months ago, he was flying only three times, that raises questions about whether testing phase on schedule.</seg>
<seg id="5">The results have failed forecasts and led to the shares falling more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its estimate of "above srednerynochnogo" to "srednerynochnogo" because of the belief that growth is limited shares in the next quarter or two.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Although the reduction in the number of aircraft deliveries was largely predictable, we are, of course, disappointed by the Transport Department figures of profit," said Doerksen in review of the stock market.</seg>
<seg id="8">We believe that Bombardier gets new CSeries orders as the flight test program.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, if not in the coming months will be announced about new orders, we expect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow her to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first prototype aircraft was introduced in March, and for the first time made the flight in September after several months of delay.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the firm CSeries orders so far, not too much — 177 because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to check the company's claims about fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new liner.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just now there are 403 15 orders and agreements with the customers and operators.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boduan was confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first plane will be put into commercial operation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also on Thursday, executives assured analysts and the media that the program is progressing according to plan.</seg>
<seg id="16">"A test model of the aircraft had not stayed on the ground longer than expected," said Boduan during a conference call, adding that the aircraft downtime were planned ground tests and software updates.</seg>
<seg id="17">All manufacturers plan to test different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">We decided to spend the first flight and make a break for updates, and so we did.</seg>
<seg id="19">So will occur during the flight test programme.</seg>
<seg id="20">The second of five test samples should take flight in the coming weeks, and all the rest will follow soon behind him, according to the company.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yet analysts are skeptical of the claim that the client will be able to start operating CSeries aircraft through the 12 months after its first flight.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bombardier said that it evaluates the commissioning and provide new information in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The slow pace of flight testing - though, apparently, and corresponds to the domestic schedule Bombardier - reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the third quarter, Bombardier okonchivshemsya September 30, net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged — 9 cents.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gross income fell slightly - from $4.20 to $4.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.</seg>
<seg id="28">The fourth in the world's second-largest aircraft maker announced that he had put 45 aircraft for the quarter, which is less than in the previous year — 57.</seg>
<seg id="29">The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="30">Order backlog aerospace research department totaled $32.9 billion at September 30, re't from 31 December.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In the field of aerospace results consistent with our goals, but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become a troubling factor," said Boduan.</seg>
<seg id="32">Gross Income on aviakosmicheskomu direction fell by 13 percent — to $2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bombardier, the world's largest maker of trains, said that gross income in this sector grew by nearly 11 percent — to $2.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="34">Order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion at September 30, slightly higher than the 31 December.</seg>
<seg id="35">The transport division income negatively impacted the problems with the execution of several large contracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">Management stated that in the fourth quarter will be presented a new plan for development.</seg>
<seg id="37">Bombardier shares of the company, which also announced that Google chief financial officer Patrick pichett enters the board of directors, fell to 8.5 percent — up from $4,83 at auction in the middle of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="38">Brazilian company Embraer SA, third in the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest competitor, Bombardier said on Thursday about reducing quarterly income on 10 percent.</seg>
