In its proposal, Greece made notable concessions, according to the sources consulted in the Eurogroup.
It promises to comply scrupulously with payments to creditors, and above all recognizes
that the current programme is the basis on which a compromise agreement for the extension of financial assistance can be found.
In addition, it accepts that this extension will be reviewed by the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF
-the three institutions formerly known as troika- although presumably that trio will now operate separately.
The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, sees "positive signs" in the request of the Greek Government
that can pave the way for a compromise between Athens and its euro partners.
President Juncker, who has held intensive conversations with the President of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem,
and with the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, in the evening as well as  this morning,
sees in this letter of request a positive sign, said community spokesman Margaritis Schinas.
Athens has negotiated around the clock in the final hours to formalize an admissible request by euro partners,
that is based on, according to the first reports, a draft jointly prepared on Monday by the Ministry and the European Commission.
Greece did not want an extension of the current rescue with associated conditions (cuts and reforms).
And Europe wants Tsipras to jump through the hoop, in order to give it some flexibility once the imposed rules are accepted.
Most likely, in the end, it is a compromise agreement, as part of the basis of the proposal submitted by Greece,
but in which the Eurogroup will include demands for Germany and company, according to the sources consulted.
There is still some bargaining to be done. 
And not very much time: the current program ends in February
and the financial needs of Greece are impractical for the Greek State without the help of its European partners.
Athens and its banks do not have access to the market. 
The economy has halted. 
Capital escape has not stopped.
And Athens no longer even has a primary surplus (excluding interest payments) that show and negotiate.
The Greek request will be examined Thursday by the Eurogroup Working Group
and Friday morning by the Ministers of the euro zone (Eurogroup), as confirmed by Dijsselbloem on Twitter as well.
The ECB gave a boost to Athens last night, with the extension of the emergency liquidity lines.
