Tsipras'' and Varoufakis offer, if accepted by the European Union, would help the ailing economy, financial situation and markets in Greece.
The first market reaction was unexpected: a decrease in premium risk and immediate increase of the euro.
although discounting the agreement for days and despite increasingly harsher arguments on both sides.
The Tsirapas Administration has opted for a "debt bridge" agreement to survive the coming six months
-to negotiate a new rescue - serving the majority of commitments,
but ignoring others by the dramatic crisis affecting the country.
Athens, aware of its lack of support, was unexpectedly transparent on Wednesday
and itsMinister of Finance, Yanis Varoufakis, published many documents that outlined its demands.
Above all, some  concessions to members were specified for the sake of an agreement.
Varoufakis responding to the wave of criticism in several capitals, which have accused Athens of not specifying its offer again and again.
Greece needs 17 billion this year to pay off its creditors, and the looming debt,
decreasing government revenues and banking deficiencies  reducing maneuverability.
According to Varoufakis' Letter of Intent, Athens requests a "bridge agreement" and in return ensures that it will pay diligently,
making reforms and cuts, and paying faster for the sake of everyone.
The Greek Government asked 1,900 million from the profits gained from the Greek debt purchase done by the ECB.
It also claims a fund of 11 billion  to stabilize their finances.
calling for the allowance of their institutions to extend theTreasury bill deadlines that can be paid.
In consideration, Greece will intend to initiate reforms (detailed enough),
Greece promises to pay off the interest groups and states that it will establish measures against corruption and tax evasion.
Greece will also request some arnica - social expenditure for the most severe issues - and will impose several red lines.
Not to cut pensions. 
Not to raise VAT. 
Not to evict.
To fully veto the privatization program the troika wanted.
To stop working toward unreasonable fiscal surpluses and to no longer extend current program and the requirement to complete it successfully.
