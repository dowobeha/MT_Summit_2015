In its proposal, Greece made notable concessions, according to the sources consulted in the European Union.
The country promises to make exact payments to creditors, and recognizes above all 
that the current program is the basis on which a compromise agreement can be found for the extension of financial assistance.
Greece further agrees that this extension be reviewed by the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF
-three institutions formerly known as troika, although that trio will presumably operate separately from now on.
The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, at the request of the Greek Government sees "good signs"
that can pave the way for a compromise between Athens and its partners in the Euro.
President Juncker, who has had intensive discussions with the President of the European Union, Jeroen Dijsselbloem,
and with the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, overnight and this morning,
sees in this letter of request as a good sign," said community spokesman Margaritis Schinas.
Athens has negotiated around the clock in the last few hours to issue a legitimate request by Euro partners
that is based, according to the first reports, on a draft prepared jointly by the Ministry and the European Commission on Monday.
Greece did not want a current rescue extension with associated conditions (cuts and reforms).
Europe wants Tsipras to comply by the book, to be flexible once accepting the determined regulations.
It is likely, in the end, that a compromise agreement, as part of the basis of the proposal be submitted by Greece,
in which the European Union will include demands from Germany and the other countries, according to sources .
Bargaining is still ongoing. 
But not too long: the current program ends in February
and Greece's financial trouble will be severe without help fromits European partners.
Athens and its financial institutions do not have access to the market. 
The economy has stagnated. 
Capital flight is still ongoing.
 Athens doesn not even have a primary surplus (excluding interest payments) to show and to negotiate with.
The Greek request will be examined Thursday by the European Union's workers union
as well as Friday morning by the Ministers of the Eurozone (European Union), as Dijsselbloem confirmed  on Twitter.
The ECB last night gave a Athens financial boost  extending the emergency liquidity lines.
