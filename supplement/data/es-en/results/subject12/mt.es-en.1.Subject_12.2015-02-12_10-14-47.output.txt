In its proposal, Greece made notable concessions, according to the sources consulted in Eurogroup.
Greece promises to comply scrupulously with payments to creditors, and above all recognizes
that the current programme is the basis for finding a compromise on the extension of financial assistance.
Greece further agrees that this extension be reviewed by the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF
-three institutions formerly known as troika, although presumably now that trio will operate separately.
The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, sees "positive signs" in the Greek Government's petition
that could pave the way for a compromise between Athens and its euro partners.
President Juncker, who held intensive talks with the President of Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem,
and with the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, last night, and this morning,
sees a positive sign in this petition letter, said community spokesman Margaritis Schinas.
Athens has negotiated around the clock in the final hours to formalize an admissible petition by euro partners,
that is based on, according to the first reports, a draft prepared jointly by the Ministry and the European Commission on Monday.
Greece did not want an extension of the current rescue with the terms listed (cuts and reforms).
And Europe wants Tsipras to pass through the hoop, in order to give some flexibility once Greece accepts the imposed rules.
The most likely outcome, in the end, would be a compromise, as part of the basis of the proposal submitted by Greece,
but in which Eurogroup will include demands for Germany and company, according to the sources consulted.
Bargaining will still go on for a while. 
And not too long: the current program ends in February
and the financial needs of Greece are impractical for the Greek State without the help of its European partners.
Athens and its banks do not have access to the market. 
The economy has stopped. 
Capital flight has not stopped.
And Athens does not even have a primary surplus (excluding interest payments) to use to show off and negotiate.
The Greek petition will be examined Thursday by the Eurogroup working group
and Friday morning by the Ministers of the euro zone (Eurogroup), as also confirmed by Dijsselbloem on Twitter.
The ECB last night gave a boost to Athens, with the extension of the emergency liquidity lines.
