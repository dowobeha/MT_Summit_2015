Tsipras and Varoufakis' offer, if it is accepted by the Eurogroup, would give a boost to the ailing economy, finances and markets in Greece.
The market's first reaction was not expected: a fall of the premium risk and immediate ascent of the euro.
Although, the markets discounted the agreement days ago, despite crossing the statements more and more racy by both sides.
The Government of Alexis Tsipras has opted for a "debt bridge" agreement to weather the next six months
-to negotiate a new rescue - serving the bulk of commitments,
but leaving aside others by the dramatic crisis affecting the country.
Athens, aware that it lacks of support, gave a dose of unexpected transparency on Wednesday
and his Minister of finance, Yanis Varoufakis, published a juicy package of documents detailing their demands.
Above all, specific some of its concessions to members for the sake of an agreement.
Varoufakis, said the barrage of criticism in several capitals, which have accused Athens of not specifying its offer again and again.
Greece needs 17 billion this year to pay its creditors, and the incipient recession,
falling government revenues and openings in banking reduce its room for manoeuvre.
According to Varoufakis' declaration of intent, Athens calls for a "bridge agreement" and in return ensures that it will pay regularly
and that will make reforms and cuts, but at a less bloody pace for all.
The Greek Government asked for 1,900 million from the profits gained from the purchase of Greek debt by the ECB.
It also claims a 11 billion fund to stabilize their banks.
And it calls for allowing their institutions extend the limit of Treasury bills that can be purchased.
In consideration, it undertakes to persevere in reforms (which is still detailed enough),
It promises to do away with interest groups and says it will adopt measures against corruption and tax evasion.
It also asks some arnica - social expenditure for the most pressing problems - and imposes several red lines.
Not to cut pensions. 
Not to raise VAT. 
Not the evictions.
No to the privatization programme at full speed that the troika wanted.
Not to the unworkable fiscal surpluses. And no to the extension of the current program and the requirement of successful completion of it.
